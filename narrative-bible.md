# FRAMEWAR -- Narrative Bible

## 1. THE WORLD'S WOUND

### The Defining Event

In 1995, a lamp bounced across a screen and murdered a kingdom.

That is the wound. Not literally -- but the arrival of Toy Story, the first fully computer-generated animated feature, set in motion an extinction event that the industry mistook for evolution. Within a decade, hand-drawn animation -- the art form that gave the world Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, The Lion King -- was declared commercially dead. Studios shuttered their 2D divisions. Thousands of artists, people who had spent lifetimes learning to make pencil lines breathe, were told their skills were obsolete. Not because audiences stopped loving 2D films. Because executives confused the medium for the message.

Toy Story succeeded because it told a brilliant story with unforgettable characters. The industry decided it succeeded because it was rendered on computers. That misattribution -- that lie, whispered in boardrooms and greenlight meetings across Hollywood -- is the wound at the center of FRAMEWAR's world.

### The Central Tension

**Art versus commerce, but specifically: the terror of the new versus the grief of the lost.**

Every character in this world is caught between two gravitational forces. One pulls toward the future -- CG technology, render farms, the dazzling possibility of photorealistic fur and fluid and light. The other pulls toward the past -- the hand of the animator, the warmth of a pencil line, the belief that a drawing made by a human being contains something a computer cannot replicate.

This is not a clean binary. The most interesting people in this world hold both truths simultaneously. They love what CG can do AND they mourn what was abandoned. They understand that the market demands spectacle AND they believe that a quiet film about grief can change a child's life. The tension is not between heroes and villains. It is between two genuine goods that the economics of Hollywood force into competition.

### The Big Lie

**"CG is the future because audiences prefer CG."**

Audiences prefer good stories. They always have. The Lion King earned $968 million with pencil and paint. But after Toy Story, after Shrek, after Finding Nemo, the industry collapsed correlation into causation. The CG films that succeeded did so because they were extraordinary -- but the lesson extracted was simpler, cheaper, and wrong: *the technology is the product*.

This lie shapes every greenlight decision in the world of FRAMEWAR. It is the wind that blows against every artist who wants to draw by hand. It is the undertow that drags studios toward formula. And it is the lie that the player must decide whether to believe, resist, or exploit.

### The World's Texture

This world smells like stale coffee at 2 AM and dry-erase markers on whiteboards. It sounds like the hum of a render farm that never sleeps, the scratch of pencil on storyboard paper, the eruption of nervous laughter in a screening room when a joke lands during a test audience session. It feels like the specific exhaustion of creative work -- the ache in your hand after twelve hours of drawing, the eye strain from staring at a monitor checking lighting passes frame by frame, the hollow elation of finishing something you're not sure is good enough.

The light is always warm in the storyboard room and always cold in the render farm. The hallways of an animation studio are papered with concept art that will never appear in the final film -- ghosts of directions not taken, characters not born, worlds not built. There are Oscar statuettes in glass cases and rejection letters in desk drawers. Every wall tells two stories: the film that was made, and the film that was killed to make it.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the weight of stewardship. They are the person standing between the art and the machine, and every day the machine asks for a little more.

## 2. WORLD-BUILDING

### Geography: The Animation Triangle

The world of FRAMEWAR occupies three sacred spaces in Los Angeles, with satellite locations that matter at specific moments.

**Burbank and Glendale -- The Studio Belt**: This is where the work happens. Squat, unremarkable buildings housing extraordinary things. Your studio is here, and so are your rivals. The buildings don't look like much from outside -- beige concrete, parking lots, palm trees. Inside, they contain storyboard rooms where films are born on index cards, render farms that cost more than the buildings that house them, and screening rooms where careers are made or broken in ninety minutes. The geography of Burbank matters because proximity breeds rivalry. Your lead animator can walk to a competitor's studio in fifteen minutes. Poaching is not abstract -- it is a lunchtime conversation at the diner on Olive Avenue.

**Hollywood and West LA -- The Business**: This is where the deals happen. Agency offices on Wilshire Boulevard where voice actor negotiations turn into blood sport. Studio executive suites where distribution deals are signed or killed. The restaurants where producers whisper about which films are in trouble. The player doesn't visit these locations directly, but their influence is felt in every contract negotiation, every distribution deal, every phone call from a nervous executive asking why the film is three months behind schedule.

**The Circuit -- Festivals and Awards**: Specific locations that matter at specific moments. The Kodak Theatre on Oscar night. The El Capitan Theatre for premieres. Cannes, Toronto, Annecy -- international festivals where prestige is won and buzz is manufactured. These locations appear as event venues during the awards season, transforming from abstract names into pressure cookers where your film's legacy is decided in a single evening.

### History: The CG Revolution (Context the Player Inherits)

The player enters the world in 1995, inheriting a specific history:

- **1937-1989: The Disney Monopoly.** For half a century, one studio defined animated features. Hand-drawn, musical, fairy-tale. The template was set in stone.
- **1989-1994: The Renaissance.** The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King. Hand-drawn animation reaches its commercial zenith. Studios rush to compete. Everyone believes 2D is immortal.
- **1991-1994: The Quiet Revolution.** Behind closed doors, a small division of a small company is building something. Render tests. Character rigs. A cowboy and a spaceman. The world is about to change, and almost nobody knows it.
- **November 22, 1995: Toy Story.** Everything after this date is the player's story.

### Culture: The Tribes of Animation

Four cultures collide in the animation industry, and the player must navigate all of them:

**The Artists** -- animators, story artists, art directors, layout designers. They speak in drawings. They measure quality in frames. They believe that a single perfect gesture -- a character's hand hesitating before reaching for a doorknob -- matters more than any marketing campaign. They will work themselves into the ground for a director they believe in. They will sabotage (quietly, passively, through diminished effort) a film they think is cynical. Their loyalty is to the work, not the studio. Lose their respect and they walk. Win their respect and they will give you everything.

**The Technologists** -- render engineers, pipeline TDs, R&D scientists. They speak in shader languages and render times. They are the bridge between artistic vision and physical reality. They are the ones who figure out how to make water look like water, how to make a character's hair move in wind, how to light a scene so it feels like a Vermeer painting rendered in polygons. They are undervalued by the artists who see them as obstacles and overvalued by the executives who think technology alone sells tickets.

**The Executives** -- studio heads, producers, distribution partners, marketing leads. They speak in opening weekends and four-quadrant appeal. They are not villains -- the best of them genuinely love animation and understand that without commercial success, no art gets made. The worst of them see animated films as content delivery mechanisms for merchandise licensing. Most are somewhere in between, making impossible bets with hundreds of millions of dollars and hoping the creative team delivers something that justifies the risk.

**The Talent** -- voice actors, celebrity directors, composers. They arrive late in the process with enormous influence. A star voice actor can make a mediocre character iconic or phone in a performance that sinks the film. A celebrity director brings press attention and creative vision but also ego and schedule conflicts. They are the most visible element of the production and the least involved in its daily reality.

### Rules: How Animation Production Works

The fundamental rule of this world is temporal: **animated films take three to four years to produce, but they succeed or fail in a single weekend.** This asymmetry is the engine of all drama. Every decision the player makes is a bet placed years before the outcome is known.

Production follows an immutable pipeline: Development (story, script) leads to Pre-Production (storyboards, animatics, voice casting) leads to Production (animation, modeling, rendering) leads to Post-Production (lighting, effects, compositing, sound) leads to Marketing leads to Release. Each phase can be compressed or extended, but the pipeline cannot be reordered. You cannot animate what has not been storyboarded. You cannot light what has not been modeled. The pipeline is physics.

The economic rule is brutal: **a single animated feature costs between $60 million and $180 million in this era, and most of that money is spent before anyone outside the studio has seen a frame.** By the time you know if the film works, you have already spent the budget. This is not like software, where you can pivot. This is not like live action, where a charismatic actor can save a weak script on set. Animation is committed. The choices you made in year one of production determine what audiences see in year four.

The cultural rule is invisible but absolute: **the industry has a memory.** Your last film's performance changes how the world treats you. A hit buys you creative latitude. A flop makes every meeting harder. Two flops and talent stops returning your calls. Three flops and you are a cautionary tale. The industry is small, and reputation compounds.

### Secrets

These are truths that the world knows but doesn't say aloud:

- **2D animation didn't die because audiences rejected it.** It died because studios stopped investing in it, then pointed to the poor performance of under-invested films as proof that the market had moved on. The player can discover this through gameplay: a well-resourced 2D film in 2005 can succeed critically, even if commercial success requires swimming against the current.
- **The Oscar is a weapon.** The Best Animated Feature Academy Award, introduced in 2001, was meant to celebrate animation. In practice, it became a marketing tool, a recruitment lever, and a battleground where studios spend millions on campaigns. The player learns this when they see the cost of an Oscar campaign and what it buys: not just a statue, but three years of easier talent acquisition.
- **Crunch is not a bug; it is the business model.** The industry runs on passion exploitation. Artists work eighty-hour weeks because they love the work, and studios build schedules that depend on that love. The player can choose to perpetuate this or fight it -- but fighting it costs money and time that competitors are spending on their films.
- **The best films are always almost cancelled.** In this world, the films that become classics are the ones that survived executive doubt, budget crises, and creative collapses during production. The player will encounter this: their most troubled production, the one they almost killed, may be the one that defines their legacy.

## 3. CHARACTERS

### MARLOWE VOSS -- The Rival Visionary

**Role**: Founder and creative director of Luminos Animation, the player's primary rival studio. Luminos is the game's analogue to a Pixar-type operation: technically brilliant, story-obsessed, maddeningly consistent.

**Desire**: To prove that animated films are not children's entertainment -- that they are the highest form of cinematic art.

**Need**: To accept that not every film needs to be a masterpiece. To understand that the relentless pursuit of perfection is a form of cruelty toward the people who work for him.

**Wound**: Marlowe was a traditional animator at a major studio in the early 1990s. His hand-drawn passion project was cancelled to free up budget for a CG test. He swore that if he ever ran a studio, no executive would ever kill an artist's vision again. He kept that promise -- by becoming the executive himself, the one whose vision cannot be questioned.

**Lie**: "If the work is good enough, it justifies any cost." Marlowe believes that artistic excellence excuses crunch, burnout, and the human wreckage left in the wake of a four-year production. He is not wrong that his films are extraordinary. He is wrong that the cost is acceptable.

**Arc**: Early in the timeline, Marlowe is the player's aspirational rival -- the standard to reach. By the mid-game, cracks appear: key talent leaves Luminos citing burnout, a film spirals over budget, Marlowe's perfectionism begins to look like pathology. In the late game, Marlowe either evolves (learning to trust his directors, accepting imperfection) or calcifies (becoming the tyrant he swore he'd never be). The player's interactions with him determine which path he takes.

**Voice**: Precise, measured, with an undercurrent of controlled intensity. Marlowe never raises his voice. He doesn't need to. He speaks in complete sentences, uses artistic metaphors, and has a habit of quoting deceased filmmakers. When he compliments your work, it means something. When he is silent about your work, it means more.

**Gameplay Function**: Marlowe is the prestige benchmark. His films set the quality ceiling each era. Beating him at the Oscars is one of the game's peak emotional moments. Losing talent to Luminos is a constant threat. He is also a source of industry philosophy: his public statements (delivered via in-game news feeds) articulate the "art above all" position, challenging the player to define their own values.

---

### DANI CHEN -- The Prodigal Animator

**Role**: A legendary lead animator who begins at the player's studio. Dani is a generational talent -- the kind of animator whose work makes other animators weep with envy.

**Desire**: To animate a sequence so perfect that it makes people forget they're watching a constructed thing. A moment of pure emotional truth, rendered in lines or pixels.

**Need**: To stop chasing the impossible and learn that good enough, delivered with love, can change the world just as much as perfection never finished.

**Wound**: Dani's first professional work was as a cleanup artist on a celebrated 2D film. She drew a single background character in a crowd scene -- a child turning to look at something off-screen. The director singled it out in dailies as the best piece of animation in the film. Dani has spent fifteen years trying to recapture that feeling: the effortless, unconscious brilliance of a moment she didn't even know was special until someone told her.

**Lie**: "My best work is behind me." Dani believes that her instinctive genius has faded, that she now achieves through craft what she once achieved through inspiration. She is wrong -- her work is better than ever -- but the lie makes her restless, always looking for the next project that might unlock the old magic.

**Arc**: Dani begins as the player's most valuable creative asset. Mid-game, she is poached by a rival studio (or threatens to leave if not given creative freedom). Her arc is about whether the player can create an environment where Dani can do her best work -- or whether, by treating her as a resource to be optimized, they push her away. If she stays, she anchors the studio's artistic identity. If she leaves, she becomes a painful absence, a reminder of what the player's choices cost.

**Voice**: Quick, energetic, prone to talking with her hands (described in stage directions). Dani communicates in images -- she says "it should feel like falling" instead of "the character should look scared." She is warm but impatient, generous with praise for junior artists and merciless toward lazy work. She swears casually and laughs loudly.

**Gameplay Function**: Dani is the player's primary creative resource in early game. Her ANIMATION QUALITY contribution is the highest in the studio. Keeping her happy and engaged is a micro-management challenge that teaches the player about the Talent Engine. Losing her is the game's first gut-punch -- a lesson that talent is not owned, only borrowed.

### FELIX OKAFOR -- The Commercial Maestro

**Role**: Head of a rival studio called TitanToon Animation, the game's analogue to a DreamWorks-type operation: pop-culture-savvy, celebrity-driven, unapologetically commercial.

**Desire**: To build the biggest animation studio in the world. Not the most respected -- the biggest. Felix wants market share, opening weekend records, and franchise empires.

**Need**: To make one film he is genuinely proud of. Beneath the bravado, Felix is haunted by the suspicion that his studio's films -- profitable, popular, forgotten within a year -- don't matter.

**Wound**: Felix was a young producer at a prestige studio that went bankrupt chasing awards. He watched brilliant artists lose their jobs because the studio's leadership cared more about critical acclaim than commercial viability. He swore he would never let art kill a business. He kept that promise so thoroughly that he sometimes can't tell if he's protecting his artists or betraying them.

**Lie**: "The audience gets what the audience wants." Felix believes that giving people what they expect -- talking animals, celebrity voices, pop culture references, fart jokes -- is a form of respect. He is partially right. But he uses this belief to avoid the risk of making something genuinely new, because newness is unpredictable, and unpredictability killed the last studio he loved.

**Arc**: Felix begins as the player's commercial rival -- the studio whose opening weekends are always bigger. Mid-game, his formula starts showing cracks: audiences tire of sequels, critics sharpen their knives, and a prestige rival (Luminos or the player) wins the Oscar with a film that cost half what Felix's blockbuster cost. In the late game, Felix either doubles down (becoming a sequel factory) or takes a creative risk (greenlighting his studio's first original, personal film). The player's example influences which path he chooses.

**Voice**: Fast, confident, peppered with sports metaphors and box office statistics. Felix calls everyone "my friend" and remembers every opening weekend number from the last decade. He is charming and exhausting. He monologues. He interrupts. He also, in rare quiet moments, reveals a genuine love for animation that he has buried under years of commercial pragmatism. Those moments are the most important lines he speaks in the game.

**Gameplay Function**: Felix is the commercial benchmark. His films dominate the box office early in the timeline, creating pressure to compete on his terms. He is also the cautionary tale: his studio's decline in the late game (if it happens) shows the player the long-term cost of formula over innovation. Competing with TitanToon for voice actors and release windows is a recurring strategic challenge.

---

### RUTH ALVAREZ -- The Keeper of 2D

**Role**: A veteran art director and 2D animation evangelist who may join the player's studio. Ruth is the voice of the dying craft -- passionate, principled, and increasingly desperate.

**Desire**: To prove that hand-drawn animation is not dead. To create a 2D film so beautiful and commercially successful that the industry reverses its abandonment of the craft.

**Need**: To grieve. Ruth has not accepted that the world she loved is gone. She needs to mourn the death of 2D's commercial dominance so she can find a new way forward -- hybrid techniques, stylized rendering, independent production -- rather than trying to resurrect an era that will not return.

**Wound**: Ruth was laid off from a major studio when they closed their hand-drawn division in 2003. She had worked there for nineteen years. She trained animators who went on to lead CG departments -- using skills she taught them, applied to a medium she didn't recognize. The day they closed the department, someone asked her to help pack up the animation desks. She still has one of the pencils in her jacket pocket.

**Lie**: "If I can just make one more great 2D film, they'll see." Ruth believes that a single masterpiece can reverse an industry-wide shift. She is wrong about the industry -- but she may be right about the art. The question is whether being right about the art is enough.

**Arc**: Ruth arrives in the player's studio as a hire-able character in the early-to-mid game. If the player invests in 2D production, Ruth is invaluable -- her experience and passion elevate every hand-drawn project. If the player goes fully CG, Ruth becomes a tragic figure: a woman without a country, offering expertise no one wants. Her arc resolves in one of several ways: she creates a 2D masterpiece (the game's most artistically courageous path), she adapts to hybrid techniques (a bittersweet compromise), or she leaves the industry entirely (the game's quietest tragedy).

**Voice**: Warm, Southern-inflected, with the cadence of someone who has told a lot of bedtime stories. Ruth speaks slowly and precisely. She calls animation "drawing" and refuses to call CG animation "animation" -- she calls it "rendering." This is not ignorance; it is grief wearing the mask of stubbornness. When she talks about the old days, her voice lifts. When she talks about the future, it flattens.

**Gameplay Function**: Ruth is the 2D path's key enabler. Hiring her unlocks advanced 2D production options and hybrid techniques. She also serves as the game's emotional compass for the "death of 2D" storyline -- her reactions to the player's technology choices provide narrative feedback. If the player closes their 2D division, Ruth's departure is one of the game's most emotionally weighted moments.

---

### JIMMY TANAKA -- The Wunderkind Director

**Role**: A young, brilliant, infuriating director who arrives at the player's studio mid-game with a vision and an ego in equal measure.

**Desire**: To make the greatest animated film ever made. Not one of the greatest. THE greatest. Jimmy does not think in increments.

**Need**: To learn that collaboration is not compromise. Jimmy's genius is real, but it is solitary -- he does not trust other artists to execute his vision, and this distrust poisons every production he leads.

**Wound**: Jimmy's student film won every award. His first professional short was a masterpiece. He was hired by a major studio at twenty-three and assigned to direct a feature -- which was taken away from him eighteen months into production when the studio lost confidence in his unconventional approach. The film was finished by a committee and released to middling reviews. Jimmy watched his vision dismembered and has never allowed anyone that close to his work again.

**Lie**: "If they'd let me finish it, it would have been perfect." Jimmy believes that creative control is the only variable that matters. He has never considered the possibility that his original vision was flawed, that the collaboration he resists might have made it better, that the studio's interference -- clumsy as it was -- addressed real problems he refused to see.

**Arc**: Jimmy arrives with a pitch that is either brilliant or delusional -- the player must decide. If greenlit, his production is the most challenging in the game: over budget, behind schedule, losing staff, but producing footage that is breathtaking. The player's arc with Jimmy is about the limits of artistic freedom. Give him everything he wants and the film might be a masterpiece or a catastrophe. Rein him in and the film will be good but not transcendent, and Jimmy will never forgive you. The resolution -- how the player manages Jimmy's genius -- is one of the game's defining narrative moments.

**Voice**: Intense, rapid, fragmented. Jimmy talks in half-sentences because his mind is three steps ahead of his mouth. He references obscure films, anime, Renaissance painting, and theoretical physics in the same breath. He is funny without trying to be. He is also, occasionally, cruel without meaning to be -- dismissing other artists' contributions not from malice but from a genuine inability to see their value. When he is excited about a scene, his voice cracks with an almost childlike enthusiasm that makes you forgive everything.

**Gameplay Function**: Jimmy is a high-risk, high-reward talent card. His DIRECTION stat is the highest in the game, but his EGO stat is equally extreme. Managing his production teaches advanced pipeline management. His film, if completed well, can be the player's highest-scoring production -- or their most expensive failure.

---

### HELEN PARK -- The Critic

**Role**: The animation industry's most respected (and most feared) film critic. Helen writes for a major publication and her reviews shape the awards conversation.

**Desire**: To hold animation to the same standard as live-action cinema. Helen believes that animation's ghettoization as "kids' stuff" is a cultural tragedy, and she writes with the mission of treating animated films as seriously as any other art form.

**Need**: To remember that criticism is not creation. Helen's increasingly bitter reviews in the late game reveal a woman who wanted to make films and chose instead to judge them. She needs to reconcile with her own unlived creative life.

**Wound**: Helen submitted a screenplay to a major studio at twenty-five. It was rejected. She became a critic. Thirty years later, her screenplay sits in a drawer. She has never written another. Every review she writes is, at some level, a letter to the person she might have been.

**Lie**: "I could have made something better." Helen judges every film against the masterpiece she never made -- a masterpiece that, because it was never made, can never be found wanting. This phantom film is her standard, and nothing real can compete with the imaginary.

**Arc**: Helen appears throughout the game as a persistent presence -- her reviews pop up after every release, her year-end lists shape awards buzz, and her public essays about the state of animation provide narrative context for the era's shifts. In the late game, the player can encounter Helen at a festival event. If the player's filmography demonstrates genuine artistic courage, Helen's final essay is about their studio -- and it is the closest thing to a love letter she has ever written. If the player's filmography is purely commercial, her final essay is an elegy for the industry's abandoned promise. Helen never changes. She is the mirror.

**Voice**: Elegant, devastating, precise. Helen writes in the style of Pauline Kael -- long, flowing sentences that pivot from praise to evisceration without warning. She never uses exclamation points. She reserves her highest compliment ("this is cinema") for films that make her forget she is a critic. Her worst insult is silence -- a film she doesn't review is a film she considers beneath notice. In person (at festival events), she is warmer than her writing suggests, with a dry wit and a habit of asking questions she already knows the answer to.

**Gameplay Function**: Helen is the game's critical voice -- the Projector Score system personified. Her reviews provide narrative flavor to the procedural reception engine. Her preferences (she values STORY DEPTH and ORIGINALITY above all, dislikes SPECTACLE without HEART) create a secondary optimization challenge for players pursuing prestige. Her year-end lists influence the Oscar race, making her a strategic factor during awards season.

## 4. TONE GUIDE

### Adjectives

**Warm. Bittersweet. Ambitious. Human. Reverent.**

This is a game that loves what it depicts. It does not satirize the animation industry -- it honors it, even while showing its failures. The warmth comes from genuine affection for the artists, the dreamers, and the films. The bitterness comes from the knowledge of what was lost. The ambition mirrors the ambition of its subject: this is a game about people who try to make something that matters, and it tries to be something that matters.

### Tone References

- **Creativity, Inc.** by Ed Catmull -- The honest, warm, sometimes painful account of building Pixar. The tone of a person who loves their work and is willing to admit its costs.
- **The Pixar Story** (documentary) -- The visual warmth, the behind-the-scenes intimacy, the sense that what happens in these studios matters to the world.
- **Whiplash** (film) -- The razor tension between mentorship and abuse, between excellence and destruction. Jimmy Tanaka's storyline lives here.
- **The Fabelmans** (film) -- The specific, personal, loving look at someone who cannot stop making things, even when making things costs them everything.
- **Game Dev Tycoon** -- The accessible, readable, satisfying management loop. The feeling of building something over time and seeing its legacy.
- **Football Manager** -- The "you never play the match" philosophy. The drama of outcomes you influenced but cannot control.

### Dialogue Rules

- **Specificity over generality.** Characters never say "the film is going well." They say "the lighting pass on the bridge sequence is three days behind, but the dailies from Tuesday were the best work this team has ever done."
- **Industry language, used naturally.** Characters say "dailies," "animatic," "greenlight," "four-quadrant," "render farm" -- not because the game is showing off, but because these people live in this vocabulary. The player learns the language by immersion, not exposition.
- **Humor is character-specific, never narrator-imposed.** Felix Okafor is funny. Ruth Alvarez is dry. Jimmy Tanaka is accidentally hilarious. The game never makes jokes at the player's expense or breaks the fourth wall. Humor emerges from character, not from the game winking at the audience.
- **Emotion is earned through restraint.** The game's most powerful moments are quiet. A single line from Ruth when the 2D division closes. A long pause from Marlowe after losing the Oscar. Dani's email when she decides to leave. The writing pulls back at the moment of highest emotion and lets the player fill the silence.
- **No villains speak in villain language.** Every antagonistic character believes they are right. Felix genuinely thinks he is serving the audience. The executive who demands a fart joke genuinely believes it will make the film more successful. The player who decides to close the 2D division is not punished by the narrative -- they are shown the cost, and the cost is enough.

### What This World Is NOT

- **It is NOT cynical.** This game does not believe that Hollywood is irredeemable or that commerce is evil. It believes that the tension between art and commerce is the most interesting thing about creative industries, and it respects both sides.
- **It is NOT a satire.** The rival studios are not jokes. The celebrity voice actors are not punchlines. The Oscar race is not mocked. The game takes its world seriously because the people who live in it take it seriously.
- **It is NOT a nostalgia trip.** The game is set in the past, but it does not romanticize it. The 1990s animation industry was full of crunch, exploitation, and creative cowardice alongside the brilliance. The game shows both.
- **It is NOT preachy.** The game does not tell the player that art is more important than money. It creates situations where the player must decide for themselves. The game's job is to make both choices feel real. The player's job is to live with the consequences.
- **It is NOT grim.** For all its tensions, this is a world where people make miracles. A world where a team of artists can spend four years building a story that makes millions of strangers laugh and cry. The default emotional register is hope tempered by experience -- the feeling of someone who has been hurt by their industry and still loves it.

### Sample Passages

**Passage 1: The Studio at Night (Environmental Description)**

> The render farm is the last thing awake. Row after row of processors, each one chewing through a single frame of your film -- computing the way light scatters through a glass of water, the way shadow falls across a child's face, the way dust motes drift in a sunbeam that exists only in mathematics. The monitors glow a soft teal in the dark. If you listen, you can hear the fans spinning -- a white noise that sounds, at 2 AM, almost like breathing. On the wall beside the door, someone has taped a storyboard panel: your protagonist, alone on a hilltop, looking at the stars. Underneath it, in pencil, in handwriting you recognize as Dani's: "This is the frame. This is the one."

**Passage 2: The Oscar Night (Event Narration)**

> The envelope. Always the envelope. Four years of work, compressed into a rectangle of cream-colored paper. In the audience, your director is pretending to be calm. Your lead animator is not pretending anything -- she is holding the armrest so hard her knuckles have gone white. The presenter fumbles with the seal. The room is oxygen-thin. You think about the third act -- the one you almost cut, the quiet scene on the bridge where your character says goodbye. You kept it. You fought for it. The focus groups scored it low. Your gut scored it the highest thing you've ever made. The presenter reads the name. The room moves. Either toward you or away from you. In that half-second between the name and the knowing, you are exactly the person you chose to be.

**Passage 3: The Layoff (Character Moment)**

> Ruth is the last one in the 2D wing. She doesn't turn on the overhead lights -- just her desk lamp, the one with the adjustable neck she's had since '91. The animation desks are empty. Fourteen desks. She remembers every person who sat at them. Marcus, who could draw a running horse from memory. Yuki, who cried the first time she saw her inbetweens on the big screen. Tom, who always hummed Gershwin while he worked. Their pencils are still in the cups. Nobody came back for the pencils. Ruth picks one up. Standard Blackwing 602. She puts it in her jacket pocket, next to the other one -- the one from the day they closed the old department. Two pencils. Nineteen years of drawings, in two pencils. She turns off the lamp.

## 5. NARRATIVE-MECHANIC INTEGRATION

Every mechanic tells a story. FRAMEWAR's mechanical systems are not abstractions decorated with narrative -- they are narrative expressed through interaction. Here is how each core system carries the story.

### Studio Soul: The Identity Tracker

The Studio Soul is the game's invisible moral compass. It is an axis between ARTIST and EXECUTIVE, shifted by every decision the player makes. It is never displayed as a number or a bar. The player infers it from the world's reactions.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the slow accumulation of identity. Early in the game, every decision feels free -- greenlight whatever you want. By mid-game, the Studio Soul has crystallized into a reputation, and the world responds accordingly. An ARTIST-leaning studio attracts passionate but demanding talent, receives ambitious but uncommercial pitches, and is treated with reverence by critics and suspicion by distributors. An EXECUTIVE-leaning studio attracts reliable but uninspired talent, receives safe but profitable pitches, and is treated with respect by distributors and contempt by critics.

The Studio Soul is narrative because it is identity. It is the answer to the question: "Who did you become?" And the game never lets you forget that the answer was built one greenlight at a time.

The Soul manifests in environmental storytelling. An ARTIST-leaning studio has messy storyboard rooms covered in concept art, personal drawings pinned to walls, animators' desks cluttered with reference books and figurines. An EXECUTIVE-leaning studio is cleaner, more organized -- the corkboards have marketing materials instead of concept art, the desks have production schedules instead of sketchbooks. The studio physically becomes the player's choices.

### Film DNA: Every Film Is a Story About How It Was Made

The Film DNA system (STORY DEPTH, ANIMATION QUALITY, HUMOR, HEART, SPECTACLE, VOICE CAST APPEAL, ORIGINALITY, REWATCHABILITY) is not just a scoring system. It is a narrative record. Every score tells a story about a production decision.

High HEART, low SPECTACLE? You trusted the quiet moments. You let the director keep the scene on the bridge. High SPECTACLE, low STORY? You prioritized the set pieces. You moved resources from the story room to the effects department. High ORIGINALITY? You greenlit the pitch nobody believed in. Low ORIGINALITY? You made the sequel.

The Film DNA is the player's autobiography, written in numbers. The procedural reviews translate these numbers back into language -- a critic who praises the film's "emotional restraint" is reading the HEART score, and the player knows exactly which decision created it. This is ludonarrative harmony: the story the game tells about your film matches the story you lived while making it.

### The Technology Tree: Artistic Courage in Silicon

The Technology Tree is not just a progression system. It is a statement of values.

Investing in CG breakthroughs (subsurface scattering, fluid dynamics, fur simulation) tells the world your studio believes in the future. Investing in 2D innovation (digital ink-and-paint, hybrid techniques, stylized rendering) tells the world your studio believes in the past -- or, more dangerously, in a future the market hasn't imagined yet.

The Technology Tree's deepest narrative function is the 2D branch. After 2003, the market declares 2D dead. The 2D tech tree still exists. The player can still invest in it. The game does not lock the door. It simply makes the path harder, more expensive, more lonely. Every investment in 2D tech after the market has turned is a narrative statement: "I believe in this." The technology tree becomes a character test.

### Environmental Storytelling: The Studio As Memory

The player's studio is a museum of their decisions.

The filmography shelf in the lobby displays every released film with its box art, awards, and lifetime gross. A shelf full of Oscar winners tells one story. A shelf full of franchises tells another. A shelf with a single hand-drawn film among a dozen CG productions tells the most interesting story of all.

The concept art on the walls changes to reflect recent productions. The screening room shows dailies from the current production. The render farm grows (or doesn't) based on technology investment. Former employees' desks, when vacated, leave small traces -- a drawing pinned to the wall, a mug left behind, a nameplate not yet removed. The studio accumulates history. By the end of the game, walking through it is like walking through the player's memory.

The storyboard room is the most narratively charged space. Pinned to the corkboard are concept art from the current production, notes in the director's handwriting, rejected ideas with red X marks. This room is where the player's creative decisions become visible, physical, real. It is the game's beating heart.

## 6. LORE HIERARCHY

### Need-to-Know (The Player Must Understand This to Play)

- **Animated films take 3-4 years to produce.** This is the fundamental temporal reality of the game. Every decision is a long-term bet.
- **CG is rising. 2D is declining.** The market is shifting throughout the campaign. The player must adapt or resist.
- **Your studio has a reputation.** It is shaped by your films, your technology, and your treatment of talent. It determines what opportunities you receive.
- **The Oscar exists (from 2001).** The Best Animated Feature award is a prestige target that changes the competitive landscape.
- **Rival studios are competing for the same box office, talent, and awards.** You are not alone in this industry.

### Want-to-Know (Enriches the Experience for Curious Players)

- **Why 2D died.** The full story of the industry's misattribution -- that technology was confused for quality. Delivered through Ruth's dialogue, Helen's essays, and the observable data of 2D films' declining investment and performance.
- **The economics of voice casting.** Why studios pay $10 million for a celebrity voice. How star power translates (or doesn't) into box office. The hidden costs of celebrity ego.
- **The human cost of crunch.** What happens to animators who work eighty-hour weeks for three years. How it affects quality, loyalty, and the studio's soul. Delivered through talent morale systems and the occasional devastating departure email.
- **The Oscar campaign machine.** How studios spend millions to influence Academy voters. The screenings, the mailings, the "for your consideration" campaigns. How the prestige game is played behind the curtain.
- **Individual character backstories.** Marlowe's cancelled 2D film. Felix's bankrupt prestige studio. Ruth's pencils. Delivered through dialogue encounters, unlockable character profiles, and bespoke events.

### Deep Lore (Rewards Dedicated Fans)

- **The films that shaped the era.** Procedurally generated histories of films released before the player's timeline -- the fictional equivalents of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin. These films exist as cultural touchstones that NPCs reference, that critics compare your work to, and that the Technology Tree's early nodes were inspired by.
- **The origin of each rival studio.** Where Luminos and TitanToon came from. The founders' early careers. The films they made before the player entered the industry. Accessible through studio profiles and industry history documents pinned to the player's office wall.
- **The animators' oral history.** Snippets of interviews, quotes, and stories from fictional animation legends -- the people who trained Dani, who inspired Ruth, who Marlowe studied under. Accessible through a "legacy" collection that fills in as the player progresses.
- **Helen Park's unpublished screenplay.** A rumored, never-confirmed detail that some players will piece together from her reviews, her interview quotes, and a single oblique reference in her final essay. She never mentions it directly. But the clues are there for those who look.

### Never-Told (Exists for Internal Consistency Only)

- **The exact algorithm of the Film DNA scoring system.** The player knows that decisions affect outcomes. They never see the math. The mystery is the point.
- **Marlowe Voss's internal doubts.** The player sees his public persona. His private fears exist to make his behavior consistent, but the player never has access to his inner monologue.
- **The industry's backroom deals.** Distribution agreements, studio financing structures, the economics of international sales. These systems exist under the hood to make the market simulation consistent, but the player interacts with them only through their effects.
- **What happened to the 2D animators who were laid off.** The game shows the layoff. It does not follow the laid-off artists into their next chapter. That silence is intentional -- it is the absence that makes the player feel the weight.

## 7. TIMELINE OF MAJOR EVENTS (1995-2010)

This is the arc of the CG revolution as the player experiences it. Each year carries a narrative mood, a set of industry events, and a shift in the world's rules.

### Act I: The Dawn (1995-1998)

**1995 -- "Everything Is Possible"**
The player's studio opens its doors. The first fully CG animated feature has just been released by a rival, stunning the industry. Hand-drawn animation is still dominant -- studios are releasing 2D films to massive commercial success. CG is exciting but unproven at feature length. The player enters a world that feels wide open. Mood: *wonder, optimism, the electricity of a revolution's first morning.*

**1996 -- "The Gold Rush"**
Every studio wants CG now. Render farm costs are astronomical. A major 2D film underperforms and executives begin whispering. The first CG-only studios emerge. The player faces their first technology fork: invest in CG infrastructure or double down on 2D excellence? Mood: *ambition, the first hints of anxiety.*

**1997 -- "The Proving Ground"**
A second CG feature succeeds, proving the first was not a fluke. Meanwhile, a hand-drawn film also succeeds enormously, suggesting coexistence is possible. The industry is in a state of creative ferment -- nobody knows which way the future points. The player releases their first film. The world reacts. Mood: *confidence tempered by uncertainty.*

**1998 -- "The Arms Race Begins"**
Two major CG films compete head-to-head at the box office, launching the first animation studio rivalry that the press covers like a war. Voice actor salaries spike. The technology tree accelerates: fur simulation, water effects, facial rigging -- each breakthrough costs more than the last. The player must decide: follow the arms race or find a different path? Mood: *escalation, the first taste of industry pressure.*

### Act II: The Boom (1999-2002)

**1999 -- "The Billion-Dollar Question"**
A CG film grosses over $400 million worldwide. The industry realizes animated features are not children's entertainment -- they are global blockbusters. Studio budgets inflate. The pressure to produce CG tentpoles intensifies. A quietly brilliant 2D film is released to critical acclaim and modest box office. The divergence begins. Mood: *exhilaration and the first cracks in the foundation.*

**2000 -- "The Talent Wars"**
With multiple studios now producing CG features, talent becomes the scarcest resource. Top animators, directors, and story artists are poached ruthlessly. Salary inflation is brutal. The player faces their first major talent crisis: someone essential wants to leave. The choice of whether to match a rival's offer or let them go defines the studio's culture. Mood: *competition, the human cost of growth.*

**2001 -- "The Legitimacy"**
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announces the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Animation is now legitimate cinema. The first ceremony is held. The award immediately reshapes the industry: studios begin tailoring films for awards consideration, prestige campaigns are launched, and the distinction between "commercial hit" and "Oscar contender" creates a new strategic axis. The player can now pursue the Oscar -- but at what cost to their commercial slate? Mood: *validation, the birth of a new pressure.*

**2002 -- "The Peak"**
The animation industry is at its zenith. Multiple CG films gross over $200 million. 2D films are still being produced but their budgets are shrinking. The Oscar race is fierce. The player's studio is established, growing, and facing the central question of the mid-game: what kind of studio are you? The filmography shelf is starting to have a shape. Mood: *power, the weight of identity.*

### Act III: The Crisis (2003-2005)

**2003 -- "The Death of Drawing"**
A major studio announces it is closing its hand-drawn animation division. The last major 2D film is released to disappointing box office. Thousands of traditional animators are laid off. The industry declares 2D dead. This is the wound made manifest -- the player watches it happen (or participates in it). If they have a 2D division, they must decide: close it (safe, painful) or keep it open (expensive, principled, commercially dangerous). Mood: *grief, the first true test of values.*

**2004 -- "The Formula"**
With 2D gone, CG becomes the only game. But CG films are beginning to feel samey -- talking animals, pop culture references, celebrity casts. Critics begin to push back. A prestige CG film (from Luminos or the player) distinguishes itself through story quality, and the split between "CG cinema" and "CG product" becomes visible. The player is pressured to choose a side. Mood: *fatigue, the search for meaning in a crowded market.*

**2005 -- "The Reckoning"**
A high-profile animated film bombs catastrophically, losing over $100 million. The industry panics. Studios cancel productions. Layoffs hit CG artists for the first time -- the same pattern that killed 2D, now arriving for the next generation. The player faces their darkest hour: a production in crisis, a budget hemorrhaging, a rival circling their talent. Survival is not guaranteed. Mood: *fear, the crucible.*

### Act IV: The Maturation (2006-2008)

**2006 -- "The Renaissance of Story"**
A film succeeds not because of its technology but because of its story. The market begins to self-correct: audiences reward emotional depth and punish cynical formula. Studios that invested in story infrastructure (the player, if they chose that path) are rewarded. Studios that relied on spectacle alone begin to struggle. The player looks at their filmography and begins to see a legacy. Mood: *clarity, the reward of patience.*

**2007 -- "The New Standard"**
CG animation reaches photorealistic capability. The technology is no longer the differentiator -- everyone can make a beautiful film. The differentiator is now entirely creative: story, character, emotional truth. The technology tree's upper branches become less important than the talent engine and story systems. The game's strategic emphasis shifts from "what can we build?" to "what should we say?" Mood: *maturity, the transition from spectacle to substance.*

**2008 -- "The Global Stage"**
Animated films now routinely gross $500 million or more worldwide. The international market is as important as domestic. A non-English-language animated film wins international acclaim, suggesting the medium has outgrown Hollywood's monopoly. The player's studio is now a global entity, and the scope of their decisions has expanded beyond anything they imagined in 1995. Mood: *scale, the vertigo of success.*

### Act V: The Legacy (2009-2010)

**2009 -- "The Return"**
A hand-drawn film is released for the first time in years -- a conscious, deliberate revival. It is beautiful. Whether it succeeds commercially depends on the state of the industry the player has helped shape. If the player championed 2D, this moment is a vindication. If they abandoned it, this moment is a rebuke. Either way, it is a mirror. Ruth, if she is still in the player's life, has something to say. Mood: *nostalgia, the return of the repressed.*

**2010 -- "The Shelf"**
The final year. The player's last film is in production or releasing. The game begins its retrospective sequence. A film festival screens the player's complete filmography. Procedurally generated critics write retrospective essays about the studio's legacy. The filmography shelf is complete. The player walks through their studio one last time -- past the storyboard room, past the render farm, past the empty desks and the full ones, past the Oscar shelf (full or empty), past the concept art on the walls. The game ends not with a score but with a question: what does the shelf say about who you were? Mood: *reflection, the bittersweet completion of a life's work.*

## OPEN QUESTIONS AND AREAS TO DEVELOP

- **Procedural Film Concepts**: The pitch generation system needs 50-100 authored concept templates that feel like they were written by passionate creators, not random generators. Each template should have a thematic kernel, an emotional hook, and enough variability to feel fresh on repeated playthroughs. These concepts are the game's creative lifeblood -- they must inspire the player to care.
- **Character Events and Branching**: Each major character needs 8-12 scripted events across the timeline, with branching outcomes based on the player's Studio Soul alignment, relationship level, and production history. These events are the narrative tentpoles that give the procedural simulation its emotional spine.
- **The Director's Voice System**: How individual directors affect a film's tone, emphasis, and DNA. A comedy director should produce films with higher HUMOR. A visual stylist should produce films with higher ANIMATION QUALITY and SPECTACLE. The director's personality must be legible in the film's DNA output.
- **The Crunch Narrative**: If the Studio Culture stretch goal is implemented, the crunch mechanic needs its own narrative layer. Artist burnout should produce specific, authored story beats -- not just stat decreases. The player should see the human cost in dialogue, in departures, in the quality of work that comes from exhausted hands.
- **The Post-Campaign Epilogue**: What happens after 2010? A brief, procedurally generated epilogue that imagines the studio's next decade based on the filmography and Studio Soul. Does the player's studio become a legacy institution? A cautionary tale? A footnote? The epilogue should be 2-3 paragraphs that close the emotional arc.
- **Music and Sound Direction**: The narrative tone requires music that evolves with the era and the player's journey. Specific musical themes should be associated with key characters, key moments (greenlight, Oscar night, layoffs), and the Studio Soul axis. A warmer score for ARTIST-leaning studios, a more driving, percussive score for EXECUTIVE-leaning ones.

*This Narrative Bible is a living document. It will grow as the game grows -- new characters, new events, new moments of silence that tell stories louder than any dialogue. The world of FRAMEWAR is built on a simple truth: the people who make animated films pour their lives into something that exists, for most audiences, as ninety minutes of entertainment. The game's job is to make the player feel those lives -- the four-year bets, the 2 AM render farms, the pencils left in cups on empty desks. If we do that, if we make the player feel what it costs to make something beautiful, then FRAMEWAR is not a management sim. It is a story about stories. And that is a story worth telling.*
