## 1. SONIC IDENTITY STATEMENT

Close your eyes. What do you hear?

The hum of a render farm at 2 AM — a low, persistent drone punctuated by hard drive clicks. The scratch of pencil on paper as a storyboard artist revises a key frame. The whir of film threading through a projector in a darkened screening room. Footsteps on studio floors that echo differently in empty hallways versus production rushes. The distant murmur of a voice recording session bleeding through soundproofed walls. Coffee machines gurgling. Fluorescent lights buzzing. And underneath it all, waiting in the silence, the possibility that this — this film, this moment, this decision — might change everything.

**FRAMEWAR sounds like creative ambition at midnight.**

Not the polished orchestral sweep of a finished film. The working sounds. The process sounds. The sounds of making something that doesn't exist yet. The sonic palette lives in the space between inspiration and deadline, between vision and compromise, between "this is going to be extraordinary" and "we're out of money."

The player never hears the films they make — they hear the studio that makes them. Every click, every transition, every notification is diegetic. The UI is not overlaid on the world. The UI IS the world. And the world sounds like work. Beautiful, exhausting, addictive work.

**Core Principle**: Audio IS game feel. The difference between approving a storyboard and rejecting it should be felt in your chest before you understand why. The sound of a box office success should make you exhale. The sound of a production crisis should tighten your shoulders. The player's body responds before their mind catches up.

**Sonic Thesis**: Silence is never empty. In FRAMEWAR, silence is the studio holding its breath before an opening weekend. Silence is a director waiting for your answer. Silence is render farm downtime. Silence is the gap between what you hoped a film would be and what the numbers say it is. We use silence like a scalpel.

## 2. SONIC PALETTE & REFERENCES

### 2.1 Palette Overview

FRAMEWAR's soundscape is built on three layers that mix and evolve across the campaign:

**LAYER 1: STUDIO AMBIENCE** — The living, breathing workspace. Organic, mechanical, relational. This is the keynote — the constant environmental bed that tells you where you are and what's happening.

**LAYER 2: INTERFACE & FEEDBACK** — Diegetic UI sounds. Tactile, immediate, specific. Every player action generates a sound that exists in the world. No "video game UI beeps." Only: paper rustling, thumbtacks pressing into cork, dry-erase markers squeaking, film reels clicking into place.

**LAYER 3: MUSIC & EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE** — Adaptive score that mirrors the era (1995-2010), the studio's emotional state, and the player's situation. The music is never decorative. It's the studio's inner monologue.

### 2.2 Palette Descriptors

**Texture**: Warm analog meets cold digital. The organic sounds of paper, pencil, human movement layered over the synthetic hum of computers, render farms, digital workstations. The texture shifts across the campaign — more analog in 1995, more digital by 2010, but never purely one or the other.

**Frequency Range**: Wide dynamic range with deliberate gaps. The render farm occupies the low-mid frequencies (120-400 Hz), a persistent bed. Human activity lives in the mid-range (500 Hz - 2 kHz) — voices, footsteps, paper, movement. High-frequency detail (2-8 kHz) is used sparingly for specific moments: the scratch of a pencil, the snap of a clapperboard, the crystalline reverb tail when an award is won. The ultra-low sub-bass (40-80 Hz) is reserved for emotional weight — a box office bomb, a studio crisis, the moment you close your 2D division.

**Spatial Design**: The studio is a 3D soundscape. The player navigates physical rooms and the audio reflects position. Stand in the storyboard room and you hear pencil scratching, paper rustling, quiet conversation. Walk to the render farm and the electrical hum rises, the cooling fans become prominent, the warmth drops away. Enter the screening room and everything softens — carpeted, sound-dampened, intimate. Spatial audio is not a technical flex. It's how the player reads the environment without looking.

**Temporal Feel**: Two modes — **Flow Time** and **Event Time**. Flow Time is the regular production rhythm: consistent ambience, gentle interface feedback, low-intensity music. The player is managing, deciding, progressing. Event Time is high-stakes moments: a film releasing, an award ceremony, a production crisis, a director confrontation. Here, the soundscape tightens. Non-essential ambience drops out. Music swells or cuts to silence. Feedback sounds sharpen. The player's attention is focused through audio contrast.

### 2.3 Reference Tracks & Touchstones

These are not "copy this" — they're tuning forks. The frequency of the emotion we're aiming for.

**For Studio Ambience:**
- The background hum of *Blade Runner* (1982) — Vangelis' synthetic drones and industrial textures. That feeling of technology working, not just existing.
- The production floor sounds from *The Social Network* (2010) — Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' use of room tone and mechanical rhythm as music.
- Real-world reference: Field recordings from Pixar's actual campus (if accessible through archival sources) — the specific acoustic signature of creative workspaces.

**For Interface/Feedback:**
- The tactile UI of *Unpacking* (2021) — Jeff van Dyck's sound design where every object has a specific, satisfying sound based on material, weight, and context. The corkboard in FRAMEWAR should feel as real as placing a mug on a shelf in Unpacking.
- The diegetic interface of *Alien: Isolation* (2014) — every beep, click, and interface sound exists in the world and follows the world's acoustic rules. Our storyboard room should sound like you're actually in a room with cork walls and paper.

**For Adaptive Music:**
- *The Social Network* score — the way Reznor/Ross use minimal piano, synthetic textures, and percussive momentum to score ambition and creation.
- *Whiplash* (2014) score by Justin Hurwitz — the tension between jazz beauty and competitive brutality. FRAMEWAR's music should have that duality: the beauty of creation and the brutality of the industry.
- Early Philip Glass (1970s minimalism) — repetitive structures that slowly evolve. The Production Pipeline's music should use minimalist patterns that shift as the film progresses.
- *Up* (2009) by Michael Giacchino — emotional precision. The "Married Life" sequence proves that music can tell a story without words. Our award ceremony moments need that clarity.

**Era-Specific Musical References (for historical flavor):**
- **1995-1998**: Randy Newman (Toy Story era) — playful orchestration, jazz-influenced, optimistic but with underlying melancholy. Gershwin echoes.
- **1999-2002**: John Williams (late-period grandeur), Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek) — big orchestral moments, the sound of animation becoming EVENT cinema.
- **2003-2005**: Thomas Newman, Danny Elfman's darker work — more complexity, more shadows, the optimism curdling into competition.
- **2006-2010**: Michael Giacchino, Alexandre Desplat — sophisticated, emotionally intelligent, willing to be quiet. Maturation.

**For Silence & Negative Space:**
- *There Will Be Blood* (2007) — Jonny Greenwood's use of silence and space. Long stretches with no music, then sudden orchestral violence. FRAMEWAR should use silence the same way: make the player aware of its absence, then break it with purpose.

### 2.4 What FRAMEWAR Does NOT Sound Like

- **Not a "casual management game"**: No cheerful ukulele. No bright marimba UI sounds. This is not Stardew Valley.
- **Not a "corporate simulation"**: No sterile office ambience. No generic "business simulation" jazz muzak. This is a creative studio, not an accounting firm.
- **Not "retro game nostalgia"**: We're evoking 1995-2010 in theme, not in audio fidelity. The sound design is modern, high-fidelity, spatially complex. We're not making a chiptune game.
- **Not "always-on music"**: Many management sims fill every second with music to avoid dead air. FRAMEWAR trusts silence. Extended periods in Flow Time may have ambience only, no music. Music arrives when it has something to say.

## 3. SFX LIBRARY — ORGANIZED BY CATEGORY

All SFX are diegetic and context-sensitive. Every sound exists in the studio's acoustic space and follows realistic propagation and reverb rules.

### 3.1 CATEGORY: UI & INTERACTION

These are the most-heard sounds in the game. They must be satisfying on the 1000th repetition.

**Greenlight Table / Corkboard Interaction:**
- `pushpin_insert_01-05.wav` (5 variations) — The sound of pressing a thumbtack into cork. Short, satisfying pressure release. Pitched slightly differently based on where on the board you're pinning. Recorded with real pushpins and real corkboard, 3-5 different mic positions for variation.
- `pushpin_remove_01-05.wav` (5 variations) — Quick pull with a tiny cork tear. Slightly more abrupt than insert.
- `paper_pin_flutter_01-03.wav` — A document fluttering slightly when pinned. Soft, airy.
- `paper_slide_on_cork_01-04.wav` — Adjusting a pinned document's position. Gentle friction.
- `paper_pickup_01-06.wav` — Lifting a concept document from the table. Crisp paper handling foley.
- `paper_place_down_01-06.wav` — Placing it back. Slightly different weight depending on document "thickness" (budget size).
- `marker_on_whiteboard_write_01-08.wav` — Dry-erase marker writing budget numbers, dates, notes. Varied stroke lengths. Recorded close to capture the squeak and friction texture.
- `marker_cap_on_01-03.wav`, `marker_cap_off_01-03.wav` — Cap removal/replacement. Small, precise.
- `greenlight_stamp_01.wav` — THE HERO SOUND. When you greenlight a film, a physical stamp presses onto the document. Deep, authoritative, with a subtle paper compression resonance. This sound should feel like commitment. Reference: a notary stamp, but warmer, less bureaucratic. 96kHz recording to capture all the mechanical detail.
- `rejection_stamp_01.wav` — Denying a pitch. Lighter, quicker, less resonant. Still a stamp, but hollow.

**Production Pipeline Board:**
- `card_slide_horizontal_01-05.wav` — A film card moving from one phase to the next on the pipeline board. Smooth cardstock on painted wood. Satisfying glide with a soft stop.
- `card_pickup_01-04.wav` — Lifting a card to inspect it. Heavier than paper.
- `card_place_back_01-04.wav` — Returning it to the board.
- `phase_complete_bell_01.wav` — When a phase completes, a small desk bell sound. NOT a generic "ding." A specific, vintage desk bell with a warm brass resonance. This should feel like progress.
- `progress_tick_01-10.wav` — During each quarter update, visible progress bars advance. The sound: a mechanical counter tick, like an old film camera frame advance or a ratchet. 10 variations to avoid repetition during long sequences.

**Storyboard Room:**
- `pencil_on_paper_sketch_01-12.wav` — Artists working. Long, varied strokes. Some light scratches, some heavier shading. Recorded with real Prismacolor pencils on animation paper. These play as ambient loops when you're in the storyboard room.
- `paper_flip_01-08.wav` — Flipping through storyboard pages on an easel.
- `eraser_on_paper_01-05.wav` — Revisions. The sound of rethinking.
- `storyboard_panel_approve_01.wav` — You approve a panel. A subtle "check mark" sound — a confident pen stroke on paper, quick and decisive.
- `storyboard_panel_reject_01.wav` — You send it back. A paper rustle plus a faint sigh/breath (from the unseen artist). Not literal — suggestive. The room reacts.

**Render Farm:**
- `computer_hum_layer_A-D.wav` — Four-layer ambient bed. A: deep 120 Hz hum (power supply resonance). B: mid-frequency 400 Hz cycling tone (CPU noise). C: high-frequency 2 kHz hiss (cooling fans). D: sporadic hard drive seek clicks. These layers mix dynamically based on render farm utilization. 100% load = all layers at full volume. 30% load = only layer A prominent, others faint.
- `hard_drive_seek_01-20.wav` — Individual drive access sounds. Used for UI feedback when allocating render resources. Pitched slightly differently per drive to suggest a "farm" of machines.
- `render_complete_chime_01.wav` — A rendering job finishes. A soft, rising synthesized chime. Not triumphant — just completion. Think: a microwave finishing, but more elegant.
- `server_boot_sequence_01.wav` — When you upgrade the render farm or it recovers from a crash. A 3-second sequence: hard drives spinning up, fans accelerating, a final settle into the steady hum. Satisfying.
- `overheating_alert_01.wav` — Crisis event. A rising, unstable tone — fan speeds increasing, electrical hum becoming strained. Uncomfortable on purpose.

**Screening Room:**
- `projector_start_01.wav` — Film projector threading and starting. Mechanical, nostalgic, warm. Even though you're screening digital animatics, the projector is a 35mm aesthetic choice. It sounds like cinema history.
- `projector_loop.wav` — The gentle whir of film running through a projector. Loopable ambient bed for the screening room. 60 seconds, seamless.
- `projector_stop_01.wav` — Winding down. The film ends, the machine stops.
- `seat_creak_01-06.wav` — Screening room chairs. Old theater seats. They creak when you (or your director, or your test audience) shift weight. These play subtly during focus test screenings to suggest human presence without showing characters.
- `test_audience_murmur_positive_01-03.wav` — A focus test is going well. Quiet laughter, pleased murmurs. Vague enough to feel like crowd presence without distinct words.
- `test_audience_murmur_negative_01-03.wav` — It's not landing. Uncomfortable silence, a cough, restless shifting. Dread.
- `test_audience_gasp_01-02.wav` — A moment lands hard (positive or negative). A collective intake of breath.

**Voice Recording Booth:**
- `booth_door_open_01-02.wav`, `booth_door_close_01-02.wav` — Heavy soundproof door. Sealed thud when closing. The acoustic space changes dramatically — outside is studio reverb, inside is dead dry.
- `microphone_adjust_01-04.wav` — Moving a studio mic on a boom stand. Mechanical, precise.
- `headphones_on_01-02.wav`, `headphones_off_01-02.wav` — Actor putting on/removing headphones. Leather pads, cable rustle.
- `talkback_button_press_01-02.wav` — You speak to the actor through the talkback. A satisfying mechanical button with a subtle electrical click.
- `script_page_turn_01-08.wav` — Actor turning script pages in the booth. Heavier paper than storyboards — 32lb script stock.
- `voice_actor_cough_01-04.wav` (used sparingly) — Human presence in the booth during downtime.

**Filmography Shelf (Studio Lobby):**
- `case_slide_in_01.wav` — A completed film's case sliding into its place on the shelf. Plastic or cardboard case on wood. This is the sound of legacy. It should feel permanent.
- `case_pickup_inspect_01-03.wav` — Picking up a past film to review its stats.
- `trophy_place_01.wav` — An Oscar statuette being placed in the glass case. Metal on glass shelf, with a faint crystalline ring. This is a hero moment sound. Record a real metal award (doesn't have to be an Oscar — any weighted trophy) on a real glass shelf.
- `trophy_case_open_01.wav`, `trophy_case_close_01.wav` — Glass door with brass hinges. Delicate, reverent.

**Menu & Navigation:**
- `footsteps_01-20.wav` — The player navigating the studio. Dress shoes on polished concrete (main halls), softer on carpet (screening room), sharper on tile (bathrooms/break rooms). 20 variations, pitch-varied, to avoid machine-gun repetition during movement.
- `door_open_01-05.wav`, `door_close_01-05.wav` — Transitioning between studio rooms. Each major room type has a unique door sound. Storyboard room: light wooden door. Render farm: heavy metal door with electronic lock beep. Screening room: soundproof door (as above).
- `elevator_call_button_01.wav` — If you expand the studio vertically (adding a second floor), an elevator button. Vintage brass button with a warm click.
- `elevator_ride_ambient.wav` — 10-second loop. Gentle mechanical hum, slight cable creak. Transition time for studio navigation.
- `light_switch_01-04.wav` — Entering a dark room (after hours, late production). A satisfying toggle switch. Lights hum to life.

**Calendar & Time:**
- `quarter_advance_01.wav` — Time moving forward one quarter. A desk calendar page turning with a faint whoosh. This happens frequently — must not be annoying. Soft, airy, quick.
- `year_advance_01.wav` — A new year. A slightly deeper calendar sound, maybe with a subtle bell or chime overtone. This marks eras.
- `clock_tick_ambient.wav` — In certain high-pressure moments (production crunch, release week), a distant wall clock ticking becomes audible in the ambience. Not constant — only during Event Time. A reminder that time is running.

### 3.2 CATEGORY: EVENTS & NOTIFICATIONS

**Talent Events:**
- `phone_ring_01.wav` — A studio desk phone. Vintage rotary or early push-button aesthetic. Rings indicate incoming events: talent offers, rival poaching attempts, distributor calls.
- `phone_pickup_01.wav` — Receiver lifted. You're taking the call (accepting the event prompt).
- `phone_hangup_01.wav` — Receiver replaced. The conversation is over.
- `knock_on_door_01-03.wav` — A director or staff member arriving at your office with news. Varies in rhythm: polite knock (routine update), urgent double-knock (crisis).
- `envelope_open_01-03.wav` — A physical letter arriving. Could be a festival invitation, an award nomination, or a legal notice. The sound of paper tearing slightly.
- `fax_machine_receive_01.wav` — For early-era (1995-2000) events. A fax arriving with box office numbers or rival studio announcements. Mechanical, nostalgic. Phases out in later years.
- `email_notification_01.wav` (2000 onward) — An email arriving on your desktop computer. A soft chime, less harsh than modern email pings. Early-2000s OS aesthetic (Mac OS 9 or early OS X).

**Production Events:**
- `alarm_subtle_01.wav` — A production issue requiring attention. Not a blaring alarm — a persistent, gentle tone. Polite but insistent.
- `crisis_alert_01.wav` — Major crisis. Render farm failure, director walkout, budget breach. A sharp, rising tone that cuts through everything. This should create genuine anxiety.
- `milestone_complete_01.wav` — A major milestone (first film greenlit, first $100M gross, first Oscar nomination). A warm, ascending chime progression. Celebratory but not saccharine. 3-second musical gesture.

**Box Office & Release:**
- `box_office_ticker_loop.wav` — During the Box Office Gauntlet, a mechanical/digital ticker displaying numbers. Think: LED displays at stock exchanges, but slower. A gentle clicking as numbers update. Loopable.
- `opening_weekend_reveal_01.wav` — The opening weekend number locks in. A decisive, final "chunk" sound — like a vault closing or a register totaling. This is the moment of truth.
- `week_advance_01.wav` — Moving from Week 1 to Week 2, etc. A soft, neutral transition tone.
- `box_office_success_01.wav` — Your film is a hit. A rising, warm musical gesture. Not a full fanfare — 2 seconds. Just enough to make you smile.
- `box_office_bomb_01.wav` — It flopped. Silence first (1 second), then a low, hollow tone that fades. The sound of disappointment settling in.

**Awards:**
- `envelope_open_award_01.wav` — The Oscar nomination envelope being opened. Crisp, ceremonial.
- `nomination_announcement_01.wav` — You're nominated. A bright, crystalline chime with a long reverb tail. Hope.
- `award_winner_announcement_01.wav` — The winner is announced. If it's you, a 5-second musical crescendo — full orchestral swell, warm and triumphant. If it's not you, silence followed by distant, muted applause. The distance is the sting.
- `applause_award_ceremony_loop.wav` — Ambient applause bed during award sequences. Recorded to feel like a real theater — spatial, warm, human.
- `trophy_accept_01.wav` — The moment you take the Oscar. A gentle metallic transfer sound, then the weight settling in your hand (subtle low-frequency resonance).

### 3.3 CATEGORY: AMBIENCE & ENVIRONMENTS

Each studio room has a 60-120 second ambient loop that plays when you're in that space. These are layered with interaction sounds and music.

**Storyboard Room Ambience:**
- `storyboard_room_ambient.wav` — Pencil scratches (quiet, intermittent), paper rustling, occasional eraser, quiet human breath and movement. Warm, mid-frequency focus. Acoustic signature: medium room reverb, wood and cork surfaces absorbing high frequencies.

**Render Farm Ambience:**
- `render_farm_ambient.wav` — Layered computer hums (as detailed in 3.1), cooling fans cycling, hard drive seeks. Cooler frequency signature, more mechanical. Low-mid frequency dominance. Acoustic signature: hard surfaces, some metallic resonance.

**Screening Room Ambience:**
- `screening_room_ambient.wav` — Projector loop (if running), otherwise near-silence. Gentle HVAC hum, very distant. Thick carpet and acoustic panels create a dead, intimate space. This room should feel like a refuge from the production chaos.

**Studio Lobby Ambience:**
- `lobby_ambient_day.wav` — Distant phone rings, footsteps on polished floors, occasional door opening/closing, faint conversation murmur (unintelligible), coffee machine gurgling. The public face of the studio. Livelier, more reverberant.
- `lobby_ambient_night.wav` — Same space, but after hours. Quiet. Just HVAC hum, a distant cleaning cart, fluorescent light buzz. Lonely but focused.

**Office (Player's Office) Ambience:**
- `office_ambient.wav` — A desktop computer hum (quiet fan), occasional keyboard typing (from your off-screen assistant or your own work), desk lamp buzz, paper shuffling. Intimate, personal. This is your space.

**Era-Specific Environmental Details:**
- **1995-1998**: More analog sounds. Landline phones, fax machines, physical mail. CRT monitor hum becomes a faint ambient layer. Render farm is smaller, quieter.
- **1999-2002**: Technology scaling up. More computers, more electrical hum. Phones transition from rotary to push-button to early cordless.
- **2003-2010**: Digital dominance. Email replaces fax. Render farm is louder, more present. Flatscreen monitors (quieter than CRTs). Cell phone rings occasionally replace desk phones for talent calls.

### 3.4 CATEGORY: TALENT & HUMAN PRESENCE

Even though we don't show characters on screen, humans exist in the audio layer.

**Voice Acting (Diegetic, In-World):**
- `voice_actor_line_read_mumble_01-20.wav` — When you're outside the recording booth or in the hallway, you hear muffled voice acting through the soundproof glass. Unintelligible but expressive — you can tell if they're doing a dramatic line or a comedic line by cadence and tone. 20 variations covering different emotional beats.
- `director_talkback_mumble_01-10.wav` — The director giving notes over talkback. Again, muffled, unintelligible, but the tone conveys approval or critique.

**Distant Conversations:**
- `office_conversation_distant_01-08.wav` — When you're in the hallway or lobby, you hear other studio staff having conversations. These are recorded far from the mic, intentionally vague. Content doesn't matter — rhythm and tone suggest normalcy or tension.

**Footsteps (Not Yours):**
- `footsteps_NPC_01-10.wav` — Someone else walking through the studio. Different shoes, different gait. These play occasionally to remind you the studio is alive.

**Breaths & Sighs:**
- `sigh_relief_01-03.wav` — After a tense decision or a good result. A character (could be the player's inner voice, could be an unseen director) exhales. Relief.
- `sigh_frustration_01-03.wav` — Bad news. Frustration or disappointment.
- `breath_hold_01.wav` — Before a major reveal (opening weekend number, award announcement). An inhale that hangs. Tension.

**Applause & Reactions:**
- `applause_premiere_distant.wav` — If you attend a premiere, distant applause outside the building. Muffled through walls. Success feels far away until you see the numbers.
- `applause_premiere_inside.wav` — Inside the theater during premiere. Warm, enveloping, human. Victory.

### 3.5 CATEGORY: FILM PRODUCTION PROCESS

These sounds represent the unseen work of making the films.

**Animation Work (Implied):**
- `light_table_hum_01.wav` — Traditional animation light table hum. Used in the storyboard room or if you're still doing 2D work. A soft, fluorescent electrical hum.
- `animation_cel_slide_01-05.wav` — Moving animation cels on a light table. Acetate on glass. Subtle, delicate.
- `ink_pen_on_cel_01-05.wav` — Inking a cel. Fine-tip marker on acetate. Very quiet, very precise.

**CG Work (Implied):**
- `keyboard_typing_animator_01-05.wav` — An animator working on a CG shot. Keyboard clatter from across the room. Different rhythm than office typing — more deliberate, with pauses for thinking.
- `mouse_click_01-10.wav` — Clicking through animation software. A satisfying mechanical click (vintage 1990s-2000s mouse aesthetic, not modern silent clicks).
- `3D_software_beep_01-05.wav` — Occasional UI beeps from animation software. Pitched and timed to suggest concentration, not chaos.

**Sound Design & Score (Meta-Layer):**
- When you allocate budget to a film's score/sound in Post-Production, you hear a 5-second snippet of non-diegetic "film score" being composed — a piano line, an orchestral phrase, a sound effect being designed. This is the only time you hear your film's audio, and it's deliberately incomplete. A tease. A reminder of the thing you're building but never fully experience.

## 4. MUSIC BRIEF

### 4.1 Musical Philosophy

FRAMEWAR's music is the studio's emotional subconscious. It tells you what you're feeling before you realize you're feeling it.

The score is adaptive, era-aware, and state-reactive. It shifts based on:
- **Studio state** (budget health, morale, reputation)
- **Production phase** (Development is exploratory; Production is tense; Release is climactic)
- **Era** (1995 sounds different from 2005)
- **Player actions** (decisions trigger musical responses)

Music is not constant. Long stretches of gameplay may have ambient sound only. Music enters when the game has something to say. A single film production might have music for 40% of its timeline — the rest is ambience and interface sound. This makes music arrival feel meaningful.

### 4.2 Instrumentation

**Core Ensemble** (present throughout the campaign, evolving):
- **Piano**: The primary melodic voice. Solo piano for intimate moments, piano with ensemble for larger emotional beats. Think: Philip Glass meets Randy Newman — repetitive structures with jazz harmony.
- **String Quartet**: Emotional architecture. Strings carry the weight of decisions, the swell of success, the ache of compromise.
- **Synthesizers**: The render farm's voice. Analog synths (Moog, ARP) for the 1990s, more digital textures (FM synthesis, granular) for the 2000s. Synths represent technology, progress, and the CG revolution.
- **Percussion**: Minimal and precise. Brushes on snare, soft mallets on toms, finger snaps, pencil taps. Rhythm is implied more than stated. When production is in crunch, percussion intensifies — rim clicks, hi-hat, urgent pulse.
- **Woodwinds** (clarinet, oboe): Occasional solo voices for specific emotional moments. A clarinet for wistful reflection (looking at your filmography shelf). An oboe for melancholy (laying off staff, closing 2D division).

**Era-Specific Additions:**
- **1995-1998**: More acoustic. Light orchestral touches — glockenspiel, harp, warm brass (muted trumpet). The sound of possibility.
- **1999-2002**: Orchestration gets bigger. French horns, full string section, timpani for award moments. The arms race is on.
- **2003-2005**: Darker palette. Cello emphasis, minor keys, dissonance in the synth layers. The shakeout.
- **2006-2010**: Maturation. Solo piano returns, chamber orchestra intimacy. Less about spectacle, more about reflection. Prepared piano, bowed vibraphone, textural ambience. The score trusts space.

### 4.3 Adaptive Layers & Systems

**Horizontal Re-Sequencing**: Musical phrases are composed in modular blocks that can be reordered based on game state.

Example: The "Development Phase Theme" has four 8-bar phrases:
- Phrase A: Piano arpeggio (hopeful, exploratory)
- Phrase B: Strings enter (warmth, collaboration)
- Phrase C: Synth pad rises (technical dimension)
- Phrase D: Percussion hints (urgency, deadline awareness)

If Development is going smoothly, the sequence is A-B-A-B-C. If the director is demanding more time, the sequence is A-C-D-C. If you're rushing it, D dominates. The player never hears the same "song" twice.

**Vertical Layering**: Tracks are built as stems that add or remove based on intensity.

Example: The "Production Phase Theme" has five layers:
1. **Ambience Layer**: Synth drone, barely musical. Always present.
2. **Pulse Layer**: Soft mallet on tom, quarter notes. Adds when production is active.
3. **Harmony Layer**: String sustains. Adds when production is on schedule.
4. **Tension Layer**: Dissonant synth stabs, irregular rhythm. Adds during crunch or budget overruns.
5. **Breakdown Layer**: All layers drop except ambience. Used during critical decisions or crises.

The game engine crossfades layers in real-time based on production health metrics.

**Leitmotif System**: Recurring musical phrases associated with specific concepts.

- **The Greenlight Motif** (4-note piano phrase, ascending): Plays when you greenlight a film. Recurs during Development and at the premiere. The motif matures across the campaign — in 1995 it's simple and bright, by 2010 it has harmonic complexity and ambiguity.
- **The Compromise Motif** (2-note descending strings): Plays when you override a director, cut budget, or choose commerce over art. It's subtle — often buried in the mix — but players who listen closely will recognize it. A musical scar.
- **The Legacy Motif** (solo cello line, lyrical and slow): First appears when your first film reaches the filmography shelf. Recurs every time you inspect past films. At the campaign's end, this motif forms the backbone of the retrospective music.
- **The Oscar Motif** (ascending orchestral line with harp and glockenspiel): Only plays during award ceremonies. When you win, the motif completes in full orchestration. When you lose, it stops mid-phrase.

**Dynamic Tempo**: Music tempo adjusts to game speed. If the player speeds up time during routine quarters, the music accelerates slightly (110 BPM -> 125 BPM) without changing pitch. If the player slows down or pauses during a tense decision, the music slows (90 BPM -> 75 BPM). This is subtle — not cartoony — but it keeps music and gameplay locked.

### 4.4 Key Musical Moments (Composed Cues)

Some moments require authored, non-adaptive music. These are scripted sequences.

**"First Greenlight" (2:00)**
- Piano solo, warm and tentative. The player's first decision. Melody is simple, almost childlike. The potential is infinite. Ends with the Greenlight Motif establishing itself.

**"First Opening Weekend" (3:30)**
- Strings and piano. The box office numbers are rolling in. The music builds slowly over the 4-week gauntlet. If the film succeeds, the final 30 seconds swell into a quiet triumph — not a fanfare, just relief and joy. If it flops, the music deflates into silence mid-phrase, leaving only the render farm hum.

**"The Oscar Win" (5:00)**
- Full orchestration. The only moment in the game with a complete, traditional film score aesthetic. Strings, brass, woodwinds, piano, harp, percussion. The Oscar Motif in full glory. This is what the player has been working toward. The music delivers. Reference: Giacchino's "Married Life" — emotionally overwhelming but never manipulative.

**"The 2D Division Closes" (4:00)**
- If the player closes their 2D animation division, this cue plays. Solo piano and cello. Minor key. Slow, mournful, but not hopeless. The sound of an era ending. The Compromise Motif threads through it. The studio ambience changes after this cue — no more pencil scratches, no more light table hum. Only the render farm.

**"The Final Film Greenlight" (2:30)**
- The player greenlights their last production, knowing the campaign is ending. The Greenlight Motif returns, but transformed. If the player has high ARTISTIC COURAGE, the motif is played in a major key with string harmonies — triumphant. If they've become a formula factory, the motif is played on a solo, slightly detuned piano — still beautiful, but hollow.

**"Retrospective / End Credits" (6:00)**
- The campaign ends with a retrospective of your filmography. This cue weaves together all the leitmotifs — Greenlight, Compromise, Legacy, Oscar (if you won). It begins with solo piano (the Legacy Motif), slowly adding strings, synths, and light orchestration. The final minute is the Greenlight Motif one last time, resolving into a warm, open chord that hangs. The question is asked but not answered: was it worth it?

### 4.5 Silence Map (Where Music Does NOT Play)

Silence is compositional. These moments are music-free by design:

- **Routine Production Quarters**: If nothing dramatic is happening, music fades out. Only ambience. The player should be able to work in Flow Time without constant emotional manipulation.
- **The Moment Before a Decision**: When a major choice prompt appears (greenlight yes/no, override director yes/no, close 2D division yes/no), all music stops. 2-3 seconds of silence. The player is alone with the decision. After they choose, music resumes.
- **Box Office Bomb Aftermath**: After a major flop, music doesn't play for the next 2-3 in-game quarters. The studio is quiet. Just ambience and footsteps. The silence is the mourning period.
- **Bankruptcy Crisis Mode**: No music. Only cold ambience — HVAC, fluorescent lights, distant phones. The studio has become a place of survival, not creation.
- **Inspection of Past Films**: When you pick up a film from your filmography shelf and review its stats, the music stops. You're looking backward. The Legacy Motif may play faintly (as if it's a memory), but no active score.

## 5. ADAPTIVE AUDIO SYSTEM DESIGN

### 5.1 System Architecture

FRAMEWAR uses a middleware-based adaptive audio engine. **Recommended platform: FMOD Studio** (or Wwise if the dev team has existing expertise).

**Why middleware?**
- Horizontal re-sequencing and vertical layering require real-time parameter control that's clunky in a basic audio engine.
- State-based mixing (studio room acoustics, era-specific ambience layers) benefits from middleware's snapshot and bus architecture.
- FMOD's scripting logic allows musical transitions based on game state variables without heavy code integration.

**Core Systems:**

**System 1: Spatial Audio & Room Acoustics**
- Each studio room has a unique acoustic profile (reverb, EQ, distance attenuation).
- Implemented via FMOD Reverb Zones. When the player enters a room, the global reverb bus switches snapshots.
  - **Storyboard Room**: 0.8s reverb decay, warm EQ (slight low-mid boost), -3dB high-frequency rolloff (cork/wood absorption).
  - **Render Farm**: 1.2s reverb decay, cooler EQ (slight high-mid boost for metallic resonance), harder early reflections.
  - **Screening Room**: 0.4s reverb decay, heavy high-frequency absorption (carpeted, acoustically treated), intimate.
  - **Lobby**: 1.8s reverb decay, bright and open, polished floors create flutter echoes on transients.
- All SFX route through the room's acoustic bus. Footsteps in the lobby sound spacious; the same footsteps in the screening room sound muffled and close.
- **3D Positional Audio**: Ambient sound sources (render farm computers, distant conversations, the projector) are placed in 3D space. The player's "camera" position determines the mix. This is critical for immersion — standing near the render farm should make it louder and more present.

**System 2: Musical Adaptive Engine**
- **Parameter 1: Production Health** (0-100, tracks budget status, schedule status, morale)
  - < 30: Tension Layer active, tempo slightly faster, minor key bias
  - 30-70: Balanced mix
  - > 70: Harmony Layer prominent, major key bias
- **Parameter 2: Era** (discrete: 1995-1998 / 1999-2002 / 2003-2005 / 2006-2010)
  - Switches instrumentation palette and reverb depth. Early eras = warmer, more reverb. Later eras = tighter, drier.
- **Parameter 3: Emotional Intensity** (0-100, spikes during events)
  - 0-20: Ambience only, no music
  - 20-50: Minimal music (1-2 layers)
  - 50-80: Full adaptive score
  - 80-100: Scripted cue takes over (Oscar ceremony, major crisis)
- **Transition Logic**: All musical transitions use crossfade or musical handoff (phrase completes before switching). No hard cuts unless dramatically intentional (e.g., music stopping when a decision prompt appears).

**System 3: Event-Driven Stingers**
- Short musical or SFX cues triggered by specific events:
  - Greenlight decision -> `greenlight_stamp.wav` + Greenlight Motif (4 notes, 2 seconds)
  - Phase completion -> `phase_complete_bell.wav` + subtle upward musical gesture
  - Opening weekend success -> `box_office_success.wav` cue (2 seconds)
  - Oscar win -> Full scripted cue override (5 minutes)
- Stingers are prioritized over adaptive music. When a stinger plays, adaptive music ducks -6dB, then returns.

**System 4: Ambience Mixer**
- Studio ambience is not a single track. It's a dynamic mix of 8-12 layers:
  - Computer hum (variable volume based on render farm usage)
  - Pencil scratches (variable based on active story artists)
  - Footsteps NPC (sporadic, random)
  - Distant conversations (random intervals, 10-30 seconds apart)
  - HVAC hum (constant)
  - Phones ringing (event-triggered)
  - Coffee machine (random, 2-5 minute intervals)
  - Clock ticking (only during Event Time)
- Each layer is a separate audio source. The game engine adjusts layer volumes based on:
  - Time of day (day vs. night shift)
  - Studio activity level (number of active productions)
  - Current room (layers audible through walls are low-passed and reduced in volume)
- This creates an ever-shifting, organic soundscape that never loops obviously.

**System 5: Voice Modulation & Processing**
- Voice actors (diegetic, muffled through booth glass) need processing:
  - Heavy low-pass filter (rolls off above 2kHz)
  - Slight reverb (glass/booth resonance)
  - Dynamic EQ to make speech unintelligible but emotionally readable
- Director talkback: Additional radio/intercom processing (bandpass 300Hz-3kHz, slight distortion).

### 5.2 Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Prototype (Weeks 1-4)**
- Build one studio room (Storyboard Room) with full spatial audio and ambience layers.
- Implement basic UI SFX (pushpins, paper, markers) with variations.
- Prototype one adaptive music cue (Development Phase Theme) with 3 vertical layers controlled by a simple parameter.
- **Goal**: Prove that the diegetic soundscape feels real and the adaptive music responds meaningfully to game state.

**Phase 2: Core Systems (Weeks 5-12)**
- Build all studio room acoustics and reverb zones.
- Complete full UI SFX library (300+ assets).
- Implement horizontal re-sequencing for 2-3 musical themes.
- Build event-driven stinger system.
- Integrate ambience mixer with 8-12 dynamic layers.
- **Goal**: The studio sounds alive and complete. Music adapts to Production Pipeline phases.

**Phase 3: Musical Composition (Weeks 13-20)**
- Compose all adaptive music stems (5-7 themes, each with 4-6 layers).
- Compose scripted cues (First Greenlight, First Opening Weekend, Oscar Win, 2D Division Closes, Final Film, Retrospective).
- Record live instruments (piano, strings, woodwinds).
- **Goal**: Full musical score is implemented and responds to all game states.

**Phase 4: Era Integration (Weeks 21-24)**
- Layer in era-specific ambience details (CRT hum in 1995, email pings in 2000, etc.).
- Adjust musical palette per era (instrumentation swaps, reverb changes).
- Test transitions across era boundaries (does 1998->1999 feel like a shift?).
- **Goal**: The soundscape evolves across the 15-year campaign. 1995 sounds distinct from 2010.

**Phase 5: Polish & Mix (Weeks 25-28)**
- Full mix pass on all audio — balance levels, EQ for clarity, compression for consistency.
- Test ambience for loop seams and repetition fatigue.
- Playtest with audio-sensitive players — gather feedback on emotional beats.
- Implement accessibility features (see Section 7).
- **Goal**: The audio is publication-ready. No rough edges, no fatigue, no confusion.

### 5.3 Technical Specifications

**Audio Format:**
- All SFX: 48kHz, 24-bit WAV (mono or stereo depending on source)
- Ambience loops: 48kHz, 24-bit WAV, stereo
- Music stems: 48kHz, 24-bit WAV, stereo, delivered as layered stems in FMOD
- Final game delivery: Compressed to OGG Vorbis (Q8, ~256kbps equivalent) for distribution

**3D Audio:**
- Attenuation model: Inverse rolloff (realistic distance decay)
- Max distance: 20 meters (studio is small enough that no sound is completely inaudible)
- Doppler: Disabled (player movement is slow, Doppler would be distracting)

**Memory Budget:**
- Target: 400MB total audio assets uncompressed, ~120MB compressed
- Streaming: Long ambience loops (>60s) and music stems stream from disk
- Loaded into memory: UI SFX, short stingers, footsteps (frequently triggered)

**Mixing Hierarchy (Prioritization):**
1. **Critical Feedback** (UI actions, decision confirmations): 0dB reference, no ducking
2. **Scripted Cues** (Oscar win, major events): -3dB, ducks all other audio -6dB
3. **Adaptive Music**: -6dB, ducks ambience -3dB when active
4. **Ambience**: -9dB baseline, fills the space, always present
5. **Footsteps/Movement**: -12dB, subtle, doesn't compete with other layers

---

## 6. MIX HIERARCHY & FREQUENCY MANAGEMENT

### 6.1 Frequency Allocation (What Lives Where)

Audio clarity in FRAMEWAR depends on strict frequency zoning. Every element occupies a specific part of the spectrum and stays there.

**Sub-Bass (20-60 Hz):**
- Reserved for emotional weight only. Not constant presence.
- Used in: Box office bomb impact, crisis events, Studio Soul shifts toward "Formula Factory."
- A subtle 40 Hz sine wave (barely audible, more felt) underscores devastating moments.

**Low Bass (60-120 Hz):**
- Render farm hum fundamental frequency.
- Music bass (when present) — upright bass, synth bass.
- These don't play simultaneously at full volume. When music bass is active, render farm hum ducks -4dB.

**Low-Mids (120-400 Hz):**
- Render farm harmonic layer (power supply resonance).
- Piano left-hand voicings.
- Male voice murmurs (distant conversations, director talkback).
- HVAC system hum.
- This range can get muddy. Solution: dynamic EQ on ambience layers to carve space when music piano is active.

**Mids (400-2000 Hz):**
- The human presence zone. Footsteps, paper rustling, door handles, most UI interactions.
- Female voice murmurs.
- Cello, viola, clarinet in music.
- This is the busiest range. Clarity comes from temporal separation (UI sounds are short transients, ambience is sustained) and careful panning (conversations left, footsteps center, paper right).

**High-Mids (2-6 kHz):**
- Clarity and air. Pencil scratches, marker squeaks, paper edge rattles, hi-hat, finger snaps.
- Violin, oboe.
- This range makes UI feel tactile. Boosting 3-4 kHz on paper sounds makes them feel crisp and present.

**Highs (6-12 kHz):**
- Shimmer and detail. Reverb tails, glockenspiel, harp, subtle synth pads.
- Only active during musical moments and specific UI actions (award trophy placement).
- Excessive high-frequency content causes ear fatigue. We're conservative here.

**Air (12-20 kHz):**
- Barely used. A touch of air on reverb tails for open, expensive-sounding spaces (lobby, screening room).
- Most players won't consciously hear this, but it contributes to perceived quality.

### 6.2 Dynamic Mixing Rules

The mix adapts in real-time based on what's happening.

**Rule 1: UI Always Wins**
- When a UI interaction happens (pushpin, marker, stamp), all other audio ducks -3dB for the duration of the sound (0.2-1.0 seconds), then returns.
- Exception: Scripted cues (Oscar win) are never ducked by UI.

**Rule 2: Music Supports, Doesn't Dominate**
- Adaptive music baseline: -6dB relative to UI.
- During high-intensity moments (Event Time), music can rise to -3dB, but ambience must also rise to maintain a sense of place.
- Silence is always an option. If a scene doesn't need music, silence is better than filler.

**Rule 3: Ambience Breathes**
- Ambience layers pulse in volume based on activity. If the studio is busy (multiple productions active, high morale), ambience layers are 10-15% louder and more varied. If the studio is quiet (post-flop, night hours), ambience thins out — only essential layers remain.

**Rule 4: Spatial Priority**
- Sounds closer to the player's position are louder and more present (duh, but worth codifying).
- Sounds in the player's current room are full-bandwidth. Sounds from adjacent rooms are low-passed (-6dB above 2kHz per wall) and reduced in volume (-10dB).
- This makes the studio feel architecturally real.

### 6.3 Mastering & Final Output

**Target Loudness:**
- Integrated LUFS: -18 LUFS (comfortable for extended play, not fatiguing)
- True Peak: -1.0 dBTP (no clipping, no distortion)
- Dynamic Range: Wide. We're not crushing the mix. Quiet moments are allowed to be quiet (down to -40dB in silent scenes). Loud moments (Oscar win, crisis alert) can peak at -6dB.

**Platform Considerations:**
- **PC (Steam)**: Players often have high-quality headphones or desktop speakers. Full dynamic range, full frequency spectrum.
- **Switch (Handheld)**: Small speakers, limited bass response. Provide an optional "Handheld Mode" EQ preset that boosts mids (500Hz-2kHz) and reduces sub-bass (below 100 Hz). This is a user toggle in Audio Settings.
- **Switch (Docked)**: Standard mix.
- **iPad**: Similar to Switch handheld. Offer the same EQ preset.

**Compression & Limiting:**
- Gentle bus compression (2:1 ratio, slow attack, medium release) on the master to glue the mix.
- Limiting only for safety (-1.0 dBTP ceiling). We're not squashing for loudness.

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN & TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 7.1 Development Team Needs

**Audio Lead / Sound Designer (1 FTE):**
- Responsible for SFX design, recording, editing, implementation in FMOD.
- Manages the ambience system and adaptive audio logic.
- Conducts all field recordings (foley, environments).
- Est. hours: 600-800 across 28-week production timeline.

**Composer (1 FTE or Contract):**
- Composes all adaptive music stems and scripted cues.
- Works closely with Audio Lead to ensure music integrates with SFX and ambience.
- Delivers stems as multi-track sessions for FMOD layering.
- Est. hours: 400-500 (composition, recording, mixing).

**Implementation Engineer (0.5 FTE, shared with game dev team):**
- Integrates FMOD with game engine (Unity/Unreal/Godot, TBD).
- Exposes game state parameters to FMOD (Production Health, Era, Emotional Intensity, etc.).
- Implements 3D audio listener positioning and room acoustic switching.
- Est. hours: 200-250.

**Voice Director (Contract, 2-3 weeks):**
- Directs recording of diegetic voice acting (muffled booth sessions, distant murmurs).
- These are not scripted lines — they're "vocal texture" performances. Actors improvise emotions and cadences.
- Est. hours: 40-60.

**Recording Budget:**
- Live musicians (piano, string quartet, woodwinds): $8,000-$12,000 (session fees + studio rental)
- Foley recording: $2,000 (studio rental, props)
- Vocal texture sessions: $3,000 (actors + studio)
- Total: ~$15,000

### 7.2 Asset Creation Pipeline

**SFX Creation:**
1. **Foley Recording Session** (Week 2-3): Record all tactile UI sounds. Bring real materials: corkboard, pushpins, paper (multiple weights), dry-erase markers, pencils, film reels, projector, etc. Record in a treated studio with multiple mic positions (close, mid, room) for flexibility.
2. **Environmental Recording** (Week 4-5): Record ambience elements. Computer hums (various PCs), hard drives, cooling fans, HVAC, fluorescent lights, footsteps on different surfaces, doors (wood, metal, soundproof). Some can be sourced from commercial libraries, but key hero sounds (greenlight stamp, pushpin, projector) must be custom.
3. **Editing & Processing** (Week 6-10): Edit recordings into individual assets. Create variations (pitch shift, time stretch, reverse, layer). Apply light processing (EQ, compression, de-noise) but preserve organic character. Export as 48kHz/24-bit WAV.
4. **Implementation in FMOD** (Week 11-16): Import into FMOD. Set up randomization (pitch, volume, sample selection) to avoid repetition. Assign to game events.

**Music Creation:**
1. **Composition & Demo** (Week 8-12): Composer writes adaptive themes as MIDI mockups. Audio Lead reviews for emotional fit and technical feasibility (layer count, transition points).
2. **Recording** (Week 13-16): Live instrument sessions. Piano, strings, woodwinds recorded separately as stems. Synths and percussion recorded/programmed in DAW.
3. **Mixing & Stem Delivery** (Week 17-20): Each theme delivered as 4-6 separate stems (piano, strings, synths, percussion, etc.) as WAV files. FMOD will layer these dynamically.
4. **Scripted Cue Production** (Week 18-22): Full composition and mixing of non-adaptive cues (Oscar win, retrospective, etc.). These are delivered as stereo WAV files.
5. **Implementation in FMOD** (Week 21-24): Set up adaptive music logic. Map game parameters to stem volumes, transitions, and horizontal re-sequencing.

**Ambience Creation:**
1. **Recording & Sourcing** (Week 4-7): Capture or source all ambience layers (computer hum, pencil scratches, distant voices, etc.).
2. **Loop Construction** (Week 8-10): Build seamless 60-120 second loops. Test for repetition fatigue (listen for 10 minutes straight — any obvious loop points?).
3. **Dynamic Layer Setup** (Week 12-14): Implement in FMOD with parameter control. Test that layers add/remove smoothly based on game state.

### 7.3 Testing & Iteration

**Audio-Specific Playtests:**
- **Week 10**: Foley and UI SFX test. Do interactions feel satisfying? Is there enough variation?
- **Week 16**: Ambience test. Does the studio feel alive? Any repetition fatigue?
- **Week 20**: Music adaptive system test. Do musical transitions feel natural? Does the score respond meaningfully to game state?
- **Week 24**: Full audio integration test. Play a complete film cycle (greenlight to release) with all audio. Does it flow?
- **Week 27**: Final polish test. Long-form playtest (2-3 hours) with audio-sensitive players. Gather qualitative feedback on emotional beats.

**Key Questions for Playtests:**
1. Can you navigate the studio with your eyes closed using only audio?
2. Do you feel the difference between a successful film and a flop, emotionally, before seeing the numbers?
3. Does the music feel like it's responding to you, or is it just background?
4. Are there any sounds that annoy you by the 10th, 50th, 100th repetition?
5. Do the studio rooms feel acoustically distinct?
6. When does silence feel intentional vs. when does it feel like missing audio?

### 7.4 Accessibility Features

FRAMEWAR's audio is central to the experience, but it must be accessible to players with hearing disabilities or audio sensitivities.

**Visual Audio Indicators:**
- **Subtitles/Captions**: Even though there's no spoken dialogue, diegetic sound events can be captioned. Example: "[Render farm hum intensifies]", "[Distant applause]", "[Projector starts]". Optional toggle in settings.
- **Event Icons**: Critical audio cues (phone ring, crisis alert, production milestone) have a small visual icon that flashes on screen in addition to the sound. This is always on, not a toggle — it's good design, not just accessibility.

**Audio Settings:**
- **Volume Sliders**: Separate control for Music, SFX, Ambience, and UI. Standard.
- **Mono Audio Toggle**: For players with hearing loss in one ear, convert the stereo mix to mono. Spatial information is lost, but all content is accessible.
- **Reduce Background Noise**: Lowers ambience layers by 50%, keeps UI and music at full volume. For players with auditory processing issues or who find dense soundscapes overwhelming.
- **Visual Beat Indicators**: For music-driven moments (awards ceremony rhythm, box office number reveal), visual pulses can sync to the musical beat. Optional toggle.
- **Photosensitivity-Safe Visual Audio**: The visual audio indicators never flash faster than 3 Hz (to avoid triggering seizures). They pulse gently.

## 8. SILENCE MAP — Where and Why Silence is Used

Silence is not absence. Silence is a sound design choice. In FRAMEWAR, silence is used surgically to create emotional weight, focus, and contrast.

### 8.1 Where Silence Occurs

**The Decision Pause (2-3 seconds)**
- **When**: Major choice prompts appear (greenlight yes/no, override director, close 2D division).
- **Why**: All music and most ambience stops. Only a faint HVAC hum remains. The player is alone with the choice. The silence makes the decision feel heavier. After they choose, sound gradually returns — ambience first, then music (if appropriate).
- **Emotional Purpose**: Weight. Responsibility. "This matters."

**The Box Office Bomb (1 second, then sparse ambience)**
- **When**: A film's 4-week box office run ends with a significant loss (>$40M deficit).
- **Why**: After the final number displays, there's 1 second of complete silence. Then: only render farm hum and a distant fluorescent light buzz. No music for the next 2-3 in-game quarters. The studio feels empty even though it's populated.
- **Emotional Purpose**: Grief. The silence is the studio holding its breath. Mourning.

**The Filmography Shelf (Ambient-Only)**
- **When**: The player inspects past films on the shelf.
- **Why**: Music stops. You hear distant studio ambience (muffled through the lobby walls) and your own footsteps, but the focus is the visual and statistical content. The Legacy Motif may play very faintly (as if it's a memory, not a present sound).
- **Emotional Purpose**: Reflection. Looking backward instead of forward. The silence creates temporal distance.

**Bankruptcy Crisis Mode (Sparse, Cold Ambience)**
- **When**: The studio enters financial crisis.
- **Why**: All music stops. Ambience reduces to only: HVAC hum, fluorescent lights buzzing, a distant phone ringing occasionally (unanswered). No pencil scratches, no footsteps, no conversations. The studio sounds dead.
- **Emotional Purpose**: Dread. Isolation. The sound of a creative space becoming a corporate shell.

**Late-Night Studio (After-Hours Ambient)**
- **When**: The player is working after hours (night shift during crunch).
- **Why**: Music is absent or minimal (solo piano at most). Ambience shifts to the night variant: no conversations, no coffee machine, just render farm hum, keyboard typing (the player's own work or a few dedicated animators), and a distant cleaning cart. Occasional footsteps. Lonely, but focused.
- **Emotional Purpose**: Solitude. Dedication. The sacrifice of time and normalcy for the work.

**The Final Greenlight Pause (5 seconds)**
- **When**: The player greenlights their final film before the campaign ends.
- **Why**: After they press the greenlight stamp, the sound of the stamp is isolated — no music, no ambience. The stamp sound reverberates in silence for 2 seconds. Then the studio ambience returns, but the music that follows is different (the transformed Greenlight Motif).
- **Emotional Purpose**: Finality. "This is the last time."

**The Moment Before the Oscar Announcement (3 seconds)**
- **When**: The award envelope is being opened. Your film is nominated.
- **Why**: All sound stops. No music, no ambience, no breath. 3 seconds of absolute silence. Then the announcement: if you win, the Oscar Win cue explodes into full orchestration. If you lose, silence continues for 1 more second, then distant, muted applause fades in.
- **Emotional Purpose**: Suspension. Hope and terror occupying the same breath.

### 8.2 Why Silence Works

Film sound design has a principle: "Silence is the loudest sound." When you remove expected audio, the player's brain notices. The absence becomes presence. In FRAMEWAR, silence serves three functions:

1. **Contrast**: Silence makes the return of sound feel significant. The Oscar Win music hits harder after 3 seconds of silence. The studio ambience feels alive again after the emptiness of bankruptcy.

2. **Focus**: Silence removes distraction. During a critical decision, music and ambience would bias the player emotionally. Silence says "this is yours to decide."

3. **Emotional Punctuation**: Silence is the period at the end of a sentence. A box office bomb doesn't need dramatic music — the silence IS the drama.

### 8.3 Implementation Notes for Silence

"Silence" in FRAMEWAR is rarely *total* silence (0dB). True silence feels unnatural and can make players think their audio is broken. Instead, "silence" is:

- **Near-Silence**: Ambience layers reduced to 1-2 elements at very low volume (-30 to -40dB). Example: HVAC hum only, barely audible.
- **No Music**: The music bus is muted, but SFX and ambience remain (unless specified otherwise).
- **Isolated Sound**: One sound in a mostly silent bed. Example: The greenlight stamp reverberating alone.

Silence is scripted into FMOD events. When a "silence moment" triggers:
1. Fade out music over 1-2 seconds (or hard stop if dramatically appropriate).
2. Duck ambience layers to specified silence profile (e.g., "HVAC only" or "total near-silence").
3. After the silence duration, ramp ambience back up (2-3 second fade).
4. Music returns only if the game state calls for it (not automatic).

## 9. PRODUCTION NOTES & CLOSING PHILOSOPHY

### 9.1 Recording Philosophy

Every hero sound in FRAMEWAR is recorded specifically for this game. No generic stock library thuds. We're building a sonic signature.

**Why custom recording matters:**
- A pushpin pressing into cork is not the same as a thumbtack in styrofoam or a pin in fabric. The player will hear this sound hundreds of times. It needs to be exactly right.
- The greenlight stamp is the game's iconic sound. It's the audio equivalent of the Mario jump. It cannot be a royalty-free "stamp.wav" from a library. It must be recorded, tuned, and processed until it feels like destiny.
- The render farm hum is the studio's heartbeat. Generic computer hum doesn't have the character we need — the specific frequency blend that feels like late-'90s/early-2000s server farms.

**What can be sourced from libraries:**
- Generic ambience elements (HVAC hum, distant traffic outside windows).
- Some musical samples (orchestral hits, synth presets as starting points for processing).
- Placeholder sounds during early prototyping.

**But everything the player directly interacts with is custom.**

### 9.2 Iteration as Faith

Audio design is iterative. The first version of the greenlight stamp will not be the final version. The adaptive music system will need tuning after playtesting. The ambience layers will need rebalancing.

This is not failure. This is the process.

**Expected iteration points:**
- **UI SFX Satisfaction**: Does the pushpin feel good on the 500th click? If not, re-record with different cork density, different pin material, different mic placement.
- **Musical Transition Smoothness**: Do horizontal re-sequencing transitions feel jarring? If yes, compose additional transition phrases or adjust crossfade timing.
- **Ambience Fatigue**: Do any ambience loops become annoying after 20 minutes? If yes, either extend the loop, add more variation, or reduce presence in the mix.
- **Emotional Beat Timing**: Does the Oscar Win music swell at the right moment? If it's 1 second too early or too late, the emotional impact is halved. Adjust timing, test again.

### 9.3 The Audio is the Soul

FRAMEWAR is a game about making things that matter. Audio is not decoration. Audio is how the player feels the studio's soul.

When the render farm hums, the player knows technology is working. When the storyboard room fills with pencil scratches, the player knows artists are creating. When the music swells during an Oscar win, the player knows victory is shared. When silence falls after a bomb, the player knows loss is real.

The game design tells the player what happened. The audio tells them what it *meant*.

This sound design document is not a checklist. It's a blueprint for making the player feel like they ran a studio — not in their head, but in their chest.

Audio IS game feel. The sound comes first, the understanding follows.
