# FRAMEWAR — Marketing Plan

**Marketing Lead**: HYPE
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: Launch-Ready Campaign Blueprint

---

## 1. THE HOOK (THIS IS EVERYTHING)

### The Five-Second Scroll-Stop

**What's the GIF?**

A hand pins a film concept card to a corkboard. The card reads "DEEP DARK — A blind deep-sea fish discovers the surface world." The hand stamps it: **GREENLIT**. The card glows and slides onto a production pipeline board. Camera pulls back. The entire studio is visible — storyboard room, render farm glowing blue, screening room in shadow. Text fades in: **FRAMEWAR. Build Your Animation Legacy.**

That is the entire pitch. That is the Steam capsule image. That is the first 5 seconds of the announcement trailer. Everything else is commentary.

### The Elevator Pitch (Three Versions)

**One Sentence:**
"Run an animation studio during the Pixar vs. DreamWorks era — greenlight films, build creative teams, and fight for box office dominance while deciding whether art or commerce wins."

**One Paragraph:**
You are a studio head from 1995 to 2010, the most volatile era in animation history. CG killed hand-drawn animation. Two mega-studios went to war. The Oscar for Best Animated Feature was created. Every film you greenlight takes four years to make and can die in a single weekend. Do you chase technology or defend tradition? Do you make the film the market wants or the film your director believes in? Your filmography is your legacy. What's on the shelf?

**One Page:**
FRAMEWAR is a management sim set during the CG revolution — the fifteen years when computer graphics murdered hand-drawn animation and two rival studios (inspired by Pixar and DreamWorks) turned animation into a billion-dollar battlefield. You run a studio. You greenlight films from a corkboard of concept pitches. You shepherd them through a six-phase production pipeline (Development, Pre-Production, Production, Post-Production, Marketing, Release) making creative and financial decisions at every gate. You hire directors with massive egos and animators with conflicting visions. You invest in a technology tree (CG breakthroughs vs. 2D innovation). You watch box office numbers roll in. You compete for the Oscar. And every decision nudges your studio's identity toward Artist or Executive — a hidden soul meter that determines who you become. This is Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies meets Creativity, Inc. This is the game where you finally get to run your own Pixar. And discover what that costs.

### The One-Image Pitch

**Hero Image Description:**
A warmly lit animation studio at night, viewed from slightly above in isometric perspective. The production pipeline board dominates the center — a wall-mounted display showing three film cards moving through phases (DEV, PRE, PROD, POST, MKT, REL). Each card is pinned with colored thumbtacks (gold, green, blue). To the left, the greenlight office — a desk lamp casting warm cream light on scattered concept cards. To the right, the render farm — rows of monitors glowing teal-blue in the dark. In the background, a screening room showing a projected animatic. In the far background, the filmography shelf — glass cases displaying film boxes with Oscar statuettes next to them. Through the windows, a city skyline at dusk. Warm browns, cream paper, strategic pops of gold/green/blue/purple. The feeling is: **this is where miracles are made, and where careers are destroyed.**

That image is the Steam library hero. That image is the press kit header. That image is what every journalist uses when they write about the game. Build that image first. Everything else follows.

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE (WHO WANTS THIS, AND WHERE DO THEY LIVE?)

### Primary Audience: Management Sim Faithful (80% of Sales Target)

**Who they are:**
PC gamers aged 20-40 who have 100+ hours in Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Planet Coaster, or Software Inc. They love systems, optimization, building something from nothing, and watching numbers go up. They are the r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, and r/managementgames communities on Reddit. They are the Steam users who wishlist every management sim that hits the store. They watch Let's Plays of Factorio and Rimworld. They care about mechanical depth, clear feedback loops, and replayability.

**What they want from FRAMEWAR:**
A fresh setting (animation studios are untapped), deep systems (the production pipeline, the talent engine, the tech tree), meaningful decisions (every choice ripples forward), and visible progression (the filmography shelf as a permanent record of their choices). They will compare FRAMEWAR to Game Dev Tycoon and The Movies within the first paragraph of every review. Our job is to make that comparison favorable.

**Where they hang out:**
- **Reddit**: r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, r/managementgames, r/gaming (occasional crossover posts)
- **Steam**: They wishlist aggressively. Discovery queue and tag-based recommendations are critical.
- **YouTube**: Let's Players who specialize in management sims (Quill18, EnterElysium, Pravus Gaming, splattercat)
- **Discord**: Management sim community servers
- **Forums**: Paradox Plaza forums, Simtropolis (city builder community with crossover), niche Discord servers for specific sim games

**Marketing approach:**
Show them the systems. The production pipeline GIF. The Film DNA breakdown. The technology tree branches. The box office formulas (players who love sims love seeing the math). Give them a demo that lets them complete one full film cycle from greenlight to release. Let them taste the loop. If the loop is good, they will wishlist and evangelize.

### Secondary Audience: Film/Animation Enthusiasts (15% of Sales Target)

**Who they are:**
People aged 25-50 who watch every Pixar documentary, who read Ed Catmull's "Creativity, Inc.," who have opinions about why DreamWorks never matched Pixar's consistency, who mourn the death of 2D animation. They may not be core gamers. They play games casually (Stardew Valley, Unpacking, narrative indies). But a game about running an animation studio during the CG revolution is their absolute catnip.

**What they want from FRAMEWAR:**
Authenticity. They want to recognize the era — the death of 2D in 2003, the birth of the Oscar in 2001, the Pixar-DreamWorks rivalry. They want the decisions to feel real (the studio soul system, the Innovation vs. Formula tension, the 2D dilemma). They want the filmography shelf to feel like a museum exhibit. They want to feel what it was like to be in that pressure cooker.

**Where they hang out:**
- **YouTube**: Every Frame a Painting, Nerdwriter1, Sideways, Lindsay Ellis, Patrick Willems (video essay channels about film craft)
- **Twitter/X**: Film Twitter, Animation Twitter (hashtags: #Animation, #Pixar, #AnimationHistory)
- **Reddit**: r/movies, r/TrueFilm, r/animation
- **Letterboxd**: The cinephile social network
- **Podcasts**: The Blank Check Podcast, You Must Remember This, any pod that deep-dives film history

**Marketing approach:**
Lead with the era. The tagline "Run your own Pixar during the most brutal fifteen years in animation history" will hook them instantly. Show them the narrative beats: the 2D collapse, the Oscar moment, the director with a vision who might destroy your budget. Give them the film-nerd Easter eggs (procedurally generated film concepts that nod to real films without naming them). Seed the game with film journalists, YouTube film essayists, and animation historians. If Karsten Runquist or Patrick Willems makes a video saying "this game gets it," that audience converts.

### Tertiary Audience: Creative Professionals (5% of Sales Target, Disproportionate Marketing Impact)

**Who they are:**
Animators, filmmakers, game developers — people who make things for a living. They will see themselves in FRAMEWAR. They will recognize the crunch dilemma, the compromise between vision and commercial viability, the specific pain of a focus group scoring your life's work at 42. They are a small audience but an incredibly vocal one.

**What they want from FRAMEWAR:**
To feel seen. They want the game to honor the craft without romanticizing it. They want the Studio Soul system to acknowledge that becoming a "formula factory" is not a moral failure — it's a survival strategy. They want the 2D path to be mechanically viable even if it's commercially harder, because that reflects the real choice real artists faced.

**Where they hang out:**
- **Twitter/X**: Animation Twitter, Game Dev Twitter, IndieGameDev communities
- **TikTok**: CreativeTok, animators posting work-in-progress, game dev diary accounts
- **YouTube**: Animator channels (Toniko Pantoja, Alayna Magnan), game dev vlog channels
- **Discord**: Animation guilds, game dev communities, creative industry servers

**Marketing approach:**
Give them the behind-the-scenes. The design docs. The narrative bible excerpts. The mechanical breakdowns of the Studio Soul system and Film DNA. Make them feel like collaborators, not consumers. When FRAMEWAR launches, they will make the TikToks. They will write the Twitter threads. They will post "This game understands what it's like" and that sentiment will ripple outward. Seed keys to working animators and game developers. Their endorsement is worth 10x more than a traditional influencer.

## 3. COMPARABLE GAMES AND POSITIONING

### Direct Comparables (The "X meets Y" Pitch)

**Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies**
The obvious one. Game Dev Tycoon's accessible studio management and procedural product creation married to The Movies' visual production pipeline. But where GDT abstracts everything into sliders and The Movies drowned in micromanagement, FRAMEWAR is the Goldilocks version: meaningful decisions at every level without busywork. This comparison is mandatory for every pitch, every press release, every Steam description.

**Two Point Hospital meets Creativity, Inc.**
Two Point's charming diegetic UI (the studio IS the interface) combined with the emotional depth of the Pixar story. Management sims are usually sterile. FRAMEWAR has heart. This comparison positions the game as "fun AND meaningful."

**Software Inc. meets the Oscars**
For the hardcore sim fans: Software Inc.'s deep business systems (hiring, budgets, competitor AI, product pipelines) but set in the high-drama world of Hollywood where awards season is a strategic meta-game. This comparison signals depth to the r/tycoon crowd.

### Unique Selling Proposition (Why This, Not That?)

**Specificity of Era:**
This is not a generic "make movies" sim. This is the CG revolution, 1995-2010. The death of 2D. The Pixar-DreamWorks war. The birth of the Oscar. Players already care about this era. We're not asking them to learn new lore — we're giving them the keys to a historical moment they already know and love.

**The Innovation vs. Formula Tension:**
No other management sim makes artistic courage a core strategic variable. Game Dev Tycoon tracks genre combos. The Movies tracks star power. FRAMEWAR asks: Do you have the guts to greenlight the film nobody asked for? And then it makes that question mechanically meaningful through the Studio Soul system, the tech tree's 2D branch, and the Film DNA's ORIGINALITY stat. The game's central tension is not "optimize for profit" — it's "what are you willing to become?"

**The Filmography as Score:**
Most management sims track money, prestige, or abstract "company value." FRAMEWAR's score is a shelf of film boxes with Oscar statues next to them. It's visible, tangible, and personal. Every playthrough ends with a legacy that looks different. That shelf is the marketing. That shelf is the screenshot players will share.

**No Competition in the Genre:**
There is no modern animation studio management sim. The Movies is 20 years old and focused on live-action. Game Dev Tycoon is the closest parallel but it's about game studios. FRAMEWAR owns an empty niche. The pitch writes itself: "Run your own Pixar." Five words. Instant comprehension. Zero confusion.

## 4. MARKETING TIMELINE (24 MONTHS TO LAUNCH)

This is the full campaign arc. Every beat is planned. Nothing is left to chance.

### Phase 1: FOUNDATION (Months -24 to -18)

**Objective**: Build internal assets and establish brand presence before public announcement.

**Deliverables:**
- **Studio identity locked**: Name, logo, brand colors (gold/green/blue/purple reputation system colors)
- **Steam page skeleton**: Developer account, app ID, basic metadata (no public visibility yet)
- **Internal playtests**: Core loop proven with paper prototypes and early digital builds
- **Marketing assets pipeline**: Identify key GIFs, screenshots, and trailer moments
- **Social media accounts created**: Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube (not active publicly, but claimed)
- **Press list compiled**: 50-100 journalists who cover management sims, indie games, and animation topics

**Key Milestone:**
Production pipeline board prototype is built and looks good enough to show. This is the core visual hook. If it's not compelling, delay the announcement.

### Phase 2: ANNOUNCEMENT (Months -18 to -16)

**Objective**: Generate awareness, capture wishlists, enter the conversation.

**Announcement Strategy:**

**The Announcement Trailer (60-90 seconds):**
- 0:00-0:05: The greenlight GIF (hand stamps GREENLIT, card slides to pipeline board)
- 0:06-0:15: Title card: **FRAMEWAR**. Subtitle: "Build Your Animation Legacy. 1995-2010."
- 0:16-0:30: Quick cuts showing the studio: storyboard room, render farm glowing, box office numbers rolling in, Oscar statue appearing on the shelf
- 0:31-0:45: The hook: "You greenlight films. You build teams. You fight for the box office. Do you chase the future or defend the past?"
- 0:46-0:60: Gameplay footage: production pipeline board with three films in motion, player clicking into a decision overlay, the filmography shelf with 8 boxes
- 0:61-0:75: Text: "Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies. Run your own Pixar. Wishlist now on Steam."
- 0:76-0:90: Final shot: Studio at night, lights glowing, filmography shelf visible. Logo. Steam logo.

**Where to Deploy:**
- **Day of the Devs**: This game is MADE for Day of the Devs. The diegetic UI, the warm aesthetic, the indie sensibility. Apply for the showcase. If accepted, this is the announcement platform.
- **PC Gaming Show** (backup if Day of the Devs doesn't pan out)
- **Simultaneous social media push**: Trailer goes live on YouTube, Twitter/X, TikTok, Reddit (r/games, r/pcgaming, r/tycoon, r/GameDevelopment, r/animation)
- **Press embargo lifts**: Send trailer + press kit + Steam page link to the 50-100 journalist list. Embargo lifts the same day as public reveal.

**Steam Page Goes Live:**
- Capsule image (production pipeline board hero image)
- Short description: "Run an animation studio during the Pixar vs. DreamWorks era. Greenlight films, shepherd them through production, and fight for box office dominance. Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies. Wishlist now."
- Long description (see Section 6)
- GIFs: Greenlight moment, pipeline board, box office reveal, filmography shelf
- Screenshots: 5-10 carefully curated images showing the studio spaces, decision overlays, and the visual warmth
- Tags: Simulation, Management, Strategy, Singleplayer, Indie, Building, Economy, Choices Matter, 2D, Atmospheric, Stylized, Animation, Creative, Historical

**Goal:** 5,000-10,000 wishlists in the first week. Management sim community takes notice. Game enters the conversation.

### Phase 3: SLOW BURN ENGAGEMENT (Months -16 to -12)

**Objective**: Keep visibility high, deepen community connection, drip-feed content without burning out the audience.

**Content Cadence:**

**Weekly Social Media Posts (Twitter/X, TikTok):**
- Behind-the-scenes art direction: Show concept art, the evolution of the production pipeline board design
- Mechanical deep dives: "How the Film DNA system works" (infographic-style post)
- Narrative snippets: "Meet Marlowe Voss, the rival studio head who never compromises" (character intro with portrait)
- Era flavor: "1995: The year CG animation changed forever. Here's what that looked like." (Historical context posts)
- Fan engagement: "What would YOUR studio specialize in? CG innovation or 2D artistry?" (Polls and questions)

**Monthly Development Blog Posts (Steam Community Hub, Parallax Studios website):**
- "How We Designed the Innovation vs. Formula Tension"
- "The Death of 2D Animation: A Historical Deep Dive"
- "Why the Filmography Shelf is the Game's True Score"
- "Building the Talent Engine: Directors, Animators, and Creative Egos"

**Press Outreach (Ongoing):**
- Pitch deeper features to gaming press: RPS, PC Gamer, Polygon, Eurogamer
- Pitch angle: "The Management Sim That Asks What You're Willing to Become"
- Target: 3-5 preview articles/interviews in this phase

**Reddit AMA (Month -14):**
- Host an AMA on r/tycoon: "We're making a management sim about running an animation studio during the Pixar vs. DreamWorks era. AUA."
- REED (designer), NOVA (narrative), PIXEL (art director), and HYPE (me) all participate in-voice
- Goal: Engage the hardcore sim community, gather feedback, capture wishlists

**GIF Strategy (Critical):**
- Create 10-15 high-quality looping GIFs showing key moments (greenlight stamp, pipeline card sliding, box office numbers counting up, Oscar trophy appearing)
- Deploy GIFs on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Steam page
- GIFs are the most shareable format. A good GIF will get reposted hundreds of times organically.

**Goal:** Maintain 500-1,000 new wishlists per month. Community stays engaged. Press coverage drips in.

### Phase 4: DEMO AND FESTIVAL CIRCUIT (Months -12 to -8)

**Objective**: Let players touch the game. Convert curiosity into commitment.

**The Demo Strategy:**

**What the Demo Includes:**
A single film cycle from greenlight to box office results. The player starts in 1997 with $60M budget. They:
1. Review 3 film concept pitches at the greenlight table
2. Greenlight one film (assigns director, budget, tech approach)
3. Manage the six-phase pipeline with 2-3 key decisions per phase
4. Reach the box office gauntlet, watch the four-week run
5. See the film added to their filmography shelf
6. Get a "Continue in Full Game" prompt

**Demo Duration**: 20-30 minutes for a focused player, 45-60 minutes for someone who reads everything.

**Why This Demo Works:**
It's the full loop. The player experiences the entire arc: decision → production → outcome → legacy. They taste the juice. If the loop is good, they wishlist. If the loop is weak, we learn that before launch and iterate.

**Demo Deployment:**

**Steam Next Fest (Target: October or February, Whichever is -10 to -8 Months from Launch):**
- The single most important PC gaming event for indie discoverability
- Upload demo build two weeks before event
- Schedule a developer livestream during Next Fest: Walk through the demo, answer questions, show late-game footage not in the demo
- Goal: 50,000-100,000 demo downloads, 20,000-40,000 wishlists added during the event

**PAX (East, West, or Indie Showcase):**
- Bring the demo to a physical booth if budget allows
- The diegetic studio interface is MADE for in-person demoing — people watching over someone's shoulder can immediately parse what's happening
- Streamers and press often attend PAX. A 15-minute hands-on is worth more than a trailer.

**Press Demo Access:**
- After Next Fest, send Steam keys for the demo to major press outlets
- Pitch: "The full loop, 30 minutes, you'll see why this is special."
- Target outlets: PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, IGN (indie desk), Polygon, Eurogamer, Kotaku

**Goal:** 100,000+ wishlists by the end of this phase. Demo conversion rate (demo downloads to wishlists) should be 30-50% for management sims if the loop is good.

### Phase 5: MARKETING RAMP (Months -8 to -3)

**Objective**: Accelerate visibility. Build hype. Prepare for launch.

**Content Escalation:**

**The Full Gameplay Trailer (2-3 minutes):**
- Not an announcement trailer — a deep dive
- Show the full studio, the full pipeline, a complete film cycle, the technology tree, the box office drama, the Oscar win
- Voice-over or on-screen text narration explaining the systems
- Release this trailer at -6 months

**Influencer Campaign (Months -6 to -4):**
- Identify 20-30 YouTube/Twitch creators who cover management sims
- Priority targets: Quill18, EnterElysium, splattercat, Pravus Gaming, Wanderbots, Retromation
- Send early access builds (3-6 months before launch)
- No payment required — management sim YouTubers LOVE early access to deep sims
- Goal: 10-15 Let's Play series (each 3-10 episodes) generating organic buzz

**Film/Animation Influencer Seeding (Months -5 to -3):**
- Identify YouTube film essayists and animation historians who might care: Karsten Runquist, Patrick Willems, Every Frame a Painting (inactive but dream scenario), Sideways
- Send personalized pitches: "We made a game about the era you covered in [specific video]. We think you'll love it."
- If even ONE of these creators makes a video, it's 500K+ views to an audience that doesn't normally see indie game marketing

**Reddit Deep-Dive Posts (Months -6, -4):**
- Post detailed design docs on relevant subreddits (with mod approval)
- "How We Designed the Studio Soul System" on r/gamedesign
- "The Real History Behind FRAMEWAR's 2D Collapse Storyline" on r/animation
- Goal: Positioning the game as thoughtful, researched, and mechanically deep

**Discord Community Launch (Month -6):**
- Create official Discord server
- Invite active wishlist community members
- Share dev updates, host Q&As, run polls on minor design decisions ("Which reputation color should the 2D tech tree use?")
- Build superfans who will evangelize on launch day

**Steam Wishlist Push Campaigns:**
- Month -6: "100K Wishlists Milestone" — thank-you post with a new GIF or screenshot
- Month -4: "Release Date Announced" (see below)
- Month -3: "Final Countdown" push

**Release Date Announcement (Month -4):**
- Lock the date. Announce it publicly.
- Trailer with date card at the end
- Press release to all outlets
- Steam page updated with exact date
- Goal: Capture the "I don't wishlist games without a date" crowd

**Goal:** 200,000+ wishlists by launch. Influencer coverage generating organic discovery. Community engaged and ready to buy day one.

### Phase 6: LAUNCH WINDOW (Months -3 to 0)

**Objective**: Convert wishlists to sales. Nail the launch. Survive the first week.

**Pre-Launch (Final 3 Months):**

**Review Code Deployment (6 Weeks Before Launch):**
- Send Steam keys to 50-100 press outlets and major YouTubers
- Include press kit: high-res screenshots, logo, fact sheet, developer bios, quote sheet
- Embargo date: 1 week before launch (gives press time to play, write, and coordinate coverage)

**Launch Trailer (1 Month Before):**
- Shorter than the gameplay trailer (60-90 seconds)
- Shows the best moments: greenlight, production decisions, box office drama, Oscar win, filmography shelf
- End card: "Available [DATE] on Steam"
- Deploy on YouTube, Twitter, Steam, Reddit, everywhere

**Pre-Order Strategy:**
- Steam does not have traditional pre-orders, but wishlist reminders go out automatically
- Consider offering a small launch discount (10% off for the first week) to incentivize day-one purchases

**Community Event (2 Weeks Before):**
- Host a "Countdown to Launch" event on Discord
- Daily reveals: new character portraits, tech tree node details, procedurally generated film concepts
- Final AMA with the full team

**Launch Day (Day 0):**

**Embargo Lifts (Day -7 to Day 0):**
- Reviews start publishing 7 days before launch
- Target: 15-25 reviews from major outlets (PC Gamer, RPS, IGN, Polygon, etc.)
- Goal: 75+ Metacritic or OpenCritic score (management sims in the 70s are considered solid, 80+ is excellent)

**Launch Day Social Media Blitz:**
- Trailer posted everywhere with "OUT NOW" messaging
- Reddit posts on all relevant subs (r/pcgaming, r/tycoon, r/indiegaming, r/Games)
- Twitter/X thread: "FRAMEWAR is out. Here's what you're getting into." (Thread explaining the hook, the systems, the heart)
- TikTok compilation: "This game lets you run your own Pixar. Here's what that looks like." (Fast cuts of gameplay, emotional beats, the Oscar moment)

**Steam Launch Strategy:**
- Steam features are critical: New and Trending, Popular New Releases
- To hit these: Wishlists converting to sales + positive reviews in the first 48 hours
- Encourage the Discord community and early players to leave positive reviews if they're genuinely enjoying it (never incentivize fake reviews, but reminding people that reviews help is fair game)

**Press Coverage Tracking:**
- Monitor every review, every Let's Play, every mention
- Engage with positive coverage (retweet, thank reviewers)
- Monitor negative coverage (learn from criticism, address bugs quickly if mentioned)

**Post-Launch (Weeks 1-4):**

**Week 1:**
- Monitor Steam reviews obsessively. Respond to bug reports. Patch fast.
- Deploy any day-one patches needed (there will be bugs, there always are)
- Social media: Share player screenshots, filmography shelves, Oscar wins
- Goal: Hit "Positive" or "Very Positive" review score on Steam (75%+ positive)

**Week 2-4:**
- Influencer coverage ramps up (Let's Play series start publishing episodes)
- Continue engaging community on Discord and social media
- Watch for viral moments (a player's cursed filmography, an unexpected Studio Soul outcome, a TikTok of someone sobbing at the 2D collapse moment)
- If sales are strong: consider expanding the press campaign to tier-2 outlets who didn't cover at launch

**Goal:** 50,000-100,000 copies sold in the first month (management sims have long tails, but a strong launch matters for Steam algorithm visibility).

### Phase 7: LONG TAIL (Months 1-12 Post-Launch)

**Objective**: Sustain sales, deepen community, prepare for DLC or expansions.

**Content Calendar (Monthly):**
- Patch notes and updates (bug fixes, balance adjustments, QOL improvements)
- Community spotlight: Share player filmographies, host "Best Studio" contests
- Seasonal sales (Steam Summer Sale, Winter Sale, Developer Sales)
- Consider a free content update at Month 6 (new film concepts, new rival studio, extended timeline to 2012)

**Influencer Maintenance:**
- Re-engage YouTubers at major milestones (100K copies sold, 1-year anniversary)
- Provide keys for giveaways

**Awards and Recognition:**
- Submit to IGF, IndieCade, BAFTA Game Awards (indie category)
- If FRAMEWAR wins or is nominated for anything, milk that PR

**DLC/Expansion Planning (Month 6-12):**
- If sales justify it, greenlight a paid expansion:
  - "The Streaming Wars" (extend timeline to 2015-2020, Netflix/Disney+ era)
  - "International Studio" (new scenario: run a Japanese anime studio or European animation house)
- Free updates maintain goodwill. Paid expansions monetize the long tail.

**Goal:** 200,000-500,000 lifetime copies sold by end of Year 1. Establish FRAMEWAR as a management sim staple.

## 5. STORE PAGE COPY (STEAM)

This is the most important sales document. Every word must convert.

### Short Description (350 characters max)

"Run an animation studio during the Pixar vs. DreamWorks era (1995-2010). Greenlight films, manage production pipelines, hire directors with massive egos, and fight for box office dominance. Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies. Your filmography is your legacy. What's on the shelf? Wishlist now."

**Why this works:**
Era specificity (instant recognition), clear comparables (trust signal), the hook ("your filmography is your legacy"), and a call to action. Every sentence does work.

### Long Description (Detailed Pitch)

---

**BUILD YOUR ANIMATION LEGACY**

It's 1995. A lamp just bounced across a screen and changed animation forever. Computer graphics killed hand-drawn animation. Two mega-studios went to war. The Oscar for Best Animated Feature was created. And you are running a studio in the middle of it all.

**FRAMEWAR** is a management simulation about the most volatile fifteen years in animation history. You are a studio head. You greenlight films. You build creative teams. You shepherd productions through years-long pipelines. You watch box office numbers roll in. You compete for awards. And every decision shapes your studio's identity: Are you an artist or an executive? Do you chase the CG revolution or defend hand-drawn tradition? Do you make the film the market wants, or the film your director believes in?

Your filmography is your legacy. What does the shelf say about who you were?

---

**CORE FEATURES**

**The Greenlight Table**
Film concepts arrive as pinned cards on a corkboard. Each pitch has a logline, visible attributes (originality, audience breadth, technical ambition), and hidden risks. You assign a director, set a budget, choose a technology approach (2D traditional, early CG, cutting-edge CG, hybrid), and commit 3-4 years of studio resources. Every greenlight is a bet on the future.

**The Production Pipeline**
Six phases: Development, Pre-Production, Production, Post-Production, Marketing, Release. Each phase has 3-5 key decisions. Do you give the director more time on the story? Do you hire the $12M celebrity voice actor? Do you crunch your animators to hit the release window? Every decision modifies your film's DNA scores (Story Depth, Animation Quality, Humor, Heart, Spectacle, Voice Cast Appeal, Originality, Rewatchability) — and those scores determine box office, critic reviews, and award chances.

**The Talent Engine**
Hire Directors with creative visions and egos to match. Build teams of Animators (speed vs. quality tradeoffs). Cast Voice Actors (star power vs. acting skill vs. salary demands). Poach talent from rivals. Lose your best animator to burnout. Fire a director who went over budget. Manage morale, loyalty, and the human cost of making art inside a machine.

**The Technology Tree (The Render Race)**
CG technology evolves throughout the timeline: fur simulation, subsurface scattering, fluid dynamics, global illumination. Invest in breakthroughs to push visual quality. Or invest in the 2D Innovation branch: digital ink-and-paint, hybrid techniques, stylized rendering. The market says 2D is dead after 2003. The market might be wrong. Or it might destroy you.

**The Box Office Gauntlet**
Release weekend is not a single number. It's a four-week run with weekly drops, critic reviews aggregating into a "Projector Score," audience word-of-mouth spreading (or collapsing), and rival releases competing for screens. Watch the numbers roll in. Feel every dollar. Then face awards season: the Academy Awards Best Animated Feature (introduced in 2001) becomes a prestige arms race. Winning an Oscar changes everything.

**The Studio Soul**
Every decision nudges your studio toward Artist or Executive. Greenlight a risky original? Support your director's vision over market testing? Keep your 2D division open when everyone else is closing theirs? You move toward Artist. Greenlight sequels? Override creative decisions for commercial safety? Close the 2D department to cut costs? You move toward Executive. The soul is invisible but its effects are everywhere: who wants to work for you, what projects get pitched, how critics treat your films. By the end of the campaign, your studio has an identity. You built it one decision at a time.

**The Filmography Shelf**
Every completed film sits on a glass shelf in your studio lobby: the box art, the awards won, the total gross. This is your score. Not a number — a shelf. 8-10 films that tell the story of your studio. Some are masterpieces. Some are compromises. Some are both. The game ends with a retrospective: a film festival screening your complete works, with procedurally generated critics reflecting on your legacy.

---

**WHAT MASTERY LOOKS LIKE**

A beginner greenlights cool-sounding projects, hires famous voice actors, and wonders why they're bankrupt by 2003.

An expert reads the market three years ahead. They balance their slate: one commercial tentpole funding one artistic risk. They time tech breakthroughs to coincide with productions that showcase them. They understand the Film DNA system deeply enough to know that HEART multiplies STORY in the review algorithm, that VOICE CAST APPEAL has diminishing returns above 7, and that ORIGINALITY is high-variance — a 9-ORIGINALITY film either wins Best Picture or bombs spectacularly.

The 50-hour player isn't just running a studio. They're curating a filmography. They're thinking about legacy.

**THE ERA LIVES**

1995: CG animation arrives. Everything feels possible.
2001: The Best Animated Feature Oscar is created. Animation is legitimate cinema now.
2003: Major studios close their hand-drawn divisions. 2D is declared dead. Thousands of animators are laid off.
2006: The market self-corrects. Story matters again. Technology alone is not enough.
2010: The era ends. Your shelf is full. What did you build?

The timeline is not static. Rival studios (procedurally generated but inspired by Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky) release films that compete with yours. Voice actor salaries inflate. Audience expectations evolve. Technology becomes obsolete. The industry has a memory: your last film's performance changes how the world treats you. Two flops and talent stops returning calls. Three flops and you're a cautionary tale.

---

**COMPARABLE GAMES**

**Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies**
The accessible studio management and procedural creation of Game Dev Tycoon, the cinematic production pipeline of The Movies — but deeper, warmer, and focused on the single most fascinating era in animation history.

**Software Inc. meets Awards Season**
Deep business simulation (hiring, budgets, tech trees, competitor AI) set in Hollywood, where the Oscars create a prestige meta-game no tech sim has.

**Cultist Simulator meets Pixar**
Diegetic, tactile interface — corkboards, physical cards, documents in the world — applied to animation production. Information is physical. The studio is the UI.

---

**YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THE SHELF**

That's the promise. Ten hours from now, when the campaign ends, you will look at the filmography shelf — the glass cases glowing in the dark, the Oscar statues catching light, the box art for films you greenlit and shepherded and watched succeed or fail — and you will know exactly what kind of studio you built.

Not because the game told you. Because the shelf showed you.

Wishlist **FRAMEWAR** now. Build your animation legacy.

**Tag Strategy:**
The first 10 tags are critical for Steam's recommendation algorithm. We want to surface to Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, and Software Inc. players. "Simulation," "Management," "Strategy," "Economy," and "Choices Matter" are mandatory. "Atmospheric" and "Stylized" signal the visual warmth. "Historical" captures the era specificity. "Animation" is niche but attracts the film enthusiast crossover audience.

## 6. SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

### Platform Breakdown

**Twitter/X (Primary Platform for PC Gaming Discovery)**

**Content Types:**
- **GIFs** (the most shareable format): Greenlight moment, pipeline card sliding, box office counting up, Oscar trophy appearing. Post one per week.
- **Screenshots** with context: "This is the storyboard room. Every pinned drawing is a decision you made." Images of the warmly lit studio spaces.
- **Design threads**: "How the Studio Soul system works: a thread." Break down mechanics in 5-10 tweets with infographics.
- **Era flavor**: "March 24, 2002: The first Best Animated Feature Oscar is awarded. Your studio is eligible. What are you greenlighting?" Historical moments tied to game mechanics.
- **Polls**: "Which would you prioritize: A $150M CG tentpole, or a $60M hand-drawn passion project?" (Engagement bait that also teaches the game's core tension)
- **Retweets and engagement**: Retweet player screenshots, respond to mentions, participate in #ScreenshotSaturday and #IndieGameDev hashtags.

**Posting Cadence:** 3-5 times per week during slow-burn phase, daily during launch window.

**Voice:** Energetic, hook-driven, informative. HYPE's voice but professional. No forced memes. No cringe. Speak to adults who love systems and stories.

**TikTok (Secondary Platform, High Viral Potential)**

**Content Types:**
- **"This game lets you..."** format: "This game lets you run your own Pixar during the CG revolution. Here's what that looks like." (30-60 second montage of gameplay with text overlay)
- **Behind-the-scenes**: "We spent six months designing this one interface. Here's why." (Art direction deep dive, time-lapse of the production pipeline board's visual evolution)
- **Emotional hooks**: "The moment your 2D division closes. The pencils left on empty desks. This game doesn't flinch." (Narrative beat with emotional music)
- **System breakdowns**: "How the Film DNA system works" (fast-paced explainer with visual aids)
- **Trending audio**: Use TikTok trending sounds where appropriate (instrumental tracks, emotional scores)

**Posting Cadence:** 2-3 times per week.

**Voice:** Fast, visual, emotional. TikTok rewards vulnerability and specificity. Show the heart of the game.

**Reddit (Strategic, Not Spammy)**

**Strategy:**
Reddit hates self-promotion. Post rarely, but when you post, make it valuable.

**Approved Post Types:**
- **Dev blogs** (with mod approval on r/gamedev, r/tycoon, r/IndieGaming): "How we designed the Innovation vs. Formula tension in FRAMEWAR"
- **Historical context** (r/animation, r/TrueFilm): "The Death of 2D Animation: What Actually Happened in 2003" (Educational post that happens to mention the game)
- **AMAs** (r/tycoon, r/IAmA): Coordinate with mods, bring the full team, answer everything
- **Milestone announcements** (r/pcgaming, r/Games): "Our animation studio management sim just hit 100K wishlists. Here's the journey." (Allowed if the post is 80% story, 20% game)

**Posting Cadence:** Monthly at most. Quality over quantity.

**YouTube (Influencer-Driven, Not Developer-Created)**

**Strategy:**
Do NOT try to be a YouTube channel. Partner with existing creators.

**Developer Channel Use Case:**
- Host the official trailers (announcement, gameplay, launch)
- Post 1-2 dev diaries if the team is comfortable on camera
- Otherwise, let influencers do the work

**Influencer Seeding:**
Send builds to Quill18, EnterElysium, splattercat, Pravus Gaming, Retromation, Wanderbots, and others. They have audiences in the hundreds of thousands who trust them. A 10-episode Let's Play series from Quill18 is worth more than any ad spend.

**Discord (Community Hub)**

**Purpose:**
Central gathering place for superfans, beta testers, and day-one buyers.

**Channels:**
- **#announcements**: Dev updates, patch notes
- **#general**: Community chat
- **#feedback**: Bug reports, suggestions
- **#showcase**: Players share their filmographies
- **#off-topic**: Build community beyond the game
- **#dev-chat**: Direct access to the team for Q&A

**Moderation:** Hire or recruit 2-3 community moderators. Respond to feedback. Make players feel heard.

**PC Gaming Press:**
- PC Gamer (UK and US)
- Rock Paper Shotgun
- IGN (indie desk)
- Polygon
- Eurogamer
- Kotaku
- GameSpot (indie coverage)

**Pitch Angle:**
"The management sim that asks what you're willing to become. FRAMEWAR is Game Dev Tycoon meets Pixar, set during the CG revolution. The innovation vs. formula tension is the core mechanic. We're sending review codes 6 weeks before launch. Interested?"

### Tier 2 Outlets (Nice-to-Have)

**Indie-Focused:**
- IndieGames.com

- Alpha Beta Gamer
- IndieGameReviewer YouTube channel

**Animation/Film Press:**
- Cartoon Brew (animation industry news)
- Animation Magazine
- Variety (if the pitch lands right)
- The Hollywood Reporter (game coverage exists, but it's a long shot)

**Pitch Angle:**
"FRAMEWAR is a game about the death of 2D animation and the Pixar-DreamWorks rivalry. We think your audience — people who care about animation history — will love this. Can we send you a build?"

### Tier 3 Outlets (Long Tail)

**YouTube Essayists and Film Critics:**
- Karsten Runquist
- Patrick Willems
- Every Frame a Painting (inactive, but dream scenario)
- Sideways
- Nerdwriter1
- Lindsay Ellis (also inactive, but if she returns and covers this, it's nuclear)

**Pitch Angle:**
Personalized emails referencing their specific work: "You made a video about [specific film/era]. FRAMEWAR is a game about that exact moment in animation history. We'd love to send you a key."

### Press Kit Contents

**Must Include:**

---

## 8. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY

### Day One: Identify the Superfans

**Where they are:**
The first 1,000 wishlisters. The people who commented on the announcement trailer. The Discord early joiners.

**How to engage:**
Personal responses. Thank them. Ask what excites them. Invite them to closed beta testing (if applicable).

### Closed Beta (Optional, 3 Months Before Launch)

**Purpose:**
Bug testing, balance feedback, and superfan validation.

**Selection:**
50-100 players from Discord, most active community members, a few press contacts.

**NDA:**
Optional. Management sims aren't story-heavy, so spoilers aren't a major concern. But ask beta testers to avoid posting major spoilers (like the endgame retrospective text) publicly.

**Feedback Loop:**
Weekly surveys. "What was the most frustrating decision?" "Which film did you care about most?" "Did the Studio Soul system feel legible or opaque?"

### Launch Day: Activate the Community

**Discord Event:**
Host a "Launch Day Hangout" where the dev team is online, answering questions, celebrating first playthroughs.

**Community Challenge:**
"Post your filmography shelf after your first campaign. The wildest shelf wins a free copy to gift a friend."

### Post-Launch: Sustain Engagement

**Monthly Events:**
- "Film of the Month": Community votes on a film concept theme (e.g., "Most Ambitious 2D Film"), players share their attempts
- "Studio Soul Showdown": Players share their final Studio Soul position and filmography, community debates which path is "better"

**Content Generation:**
Encourage players to screenshot their filmography shelves, their Studio Soul outcomes, their Oscar wins. Retweet, repost, celebrate their stories. Players are the marketing after launch.

## 9. TRAILER SCRIPT (ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER, 90 SECONDS)

**[0:00-0:05]**
BLACK SCREEN. Sound: Pencil scratching on paper.

A hand pins a film concept card to a corkboard.

**CARD TEXT:**
"DEEP DARK — A blind deep-sea fish discovers the surface world."

The hand stamps the card: **GREENLIT**.

The card glows (subtle gold pulse) and slides to the right, onto a production pipeline board.

**[0:06-0:10]**
Camera pulls back. The production pipeline board is visible: six sections (DEV, PRE, PROD, POST, MKT, REL). Three film cards are in various phases, pinned with colored thumbtacks.

Sound: Soft ambient hum of a render farm.

**[0:11-0:15]**
Title card fades in over the pipeline board.

**TEXT:**
**FRAMEWAR**
*Build Your Animation Legacy*
*1995 - 2010*

Sound: A single piano note (warm, emotional).

**[0:16-0:25]**
Quick cuts (1-2 seconds each) showing studio spaces:
- The storyboard room: Walls covered in pinned drawings, warm lamplight
- The render farm: Rows of monitors glowing teal-blue in the dark
- The screening room: A projection screen showing box office numbers counting up
- The greenlight office: A desk with scattered concept cards, a coffee cup, an Oscar statuette catching light

Sound: Layered ambient audio — render farm hum, pencil scratches, soft jazz, distant keyboard typing.

**[0:26-0:35]**
On-screen text over gameplay footage.

**TEXT:**
"You greenlight films."

Footage: A player's cursor clicking a film concept card. The card expands into a decision overlay.

**TEXT:**
"You build creative teams."

Footage: The talent roster screen. Character portraits arranged in a grid. A player drags a Director portrait onto a film card.

**TEXT:**
"You fight for box office dominance."

Footage: The box office gauntlet screen. Revenue numbers counting up. Week 2 drop-off displayed. A green checkmark appears: "Profitable."

Sound: Electronic counting sounds, a cash register ding.

**[0:36-0:45]**
On-screen text over a single continuous shot.

**TEXT:**
"Do you chase the future?"

Footage: The technology tree screen. CG breakthroughs glowing blue. A player clicks "Advanced Fur Simulation." The node lights up.

**TEXT:**
"Or defend the past?"

Footage: The technology tree 2D branch. "Hand-Drawn/CG Compositing" node glowing purple. A player clicks it.

**[0:46-0:55]**
On-screen text over narrative beats.

**TEXT:**
"1995: CG animation changes everything."

Footage: A film card labeled "Tech Demo" with INNOVATION BLUE pin.

**TEXT:**
"2001: The Oscar is created."

Footage: A gold Oscar trophy icon appearing on screen with a subtle chime. Confetti (very subtle).

**TEXT:**
"2003: 2D animation dies."

Footage: A dark hallway. Empty animation desks. A single pencil left in a cup. No music. Just silence. (This moment should HIT.)

Sound: Silence for 1 second. Then the piano returns, quieter, sadder.

**[0:56-1:05]**
On-screen text over the filmography shelf.

**TEXT:**
"Your filmography is your legacy."

Footage: Camera pans slowly across the filmography shelf. 8 film boxes on glass shelves under warm spotlights. Some have Oscar trophies next to them. One box is hand-drawn art style (2D film). The rest are CG.

**TEXT:**
"What's on the shelf?"

The camera holds on the shelf. The light glows. Fade to black.

**[1:06-1:15]**
Black screen.

**TEXT (white on black):**
**Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies**

(Pause)

**Run your own Pixar.**

(Pause)

**Wishlist now on Steam.**

**[1:16-1:20]**
Logo: **FRAMEWAR**

Steam logo appears below.

**[1:21-1:30]**
Final shot: The studio at night. Wide isometric view. All rooms visible. Lights glowing. The render farm hums. The filmography shelf shines. A single figure (implied, silhouette) stands in the greenlight office, looking at the corkboard.

Sound: Soft jazz fades in. The render farm hum continues underneath.

Fade to black.

**END.**

## 10. PLAYER TESTIMONIAL STRATEGY (POST-LAUNCH)

### The Goal

The best marketing is players telling their own stories. FRAMEWAR is BUILT for this. Every player's filmography is unique. Every Studio Soul outcome is different. Every campaign ends with a shelf that tells a story.

### How to Activate

**Week 1 Post-Launch:**
Social media call-to-action: "Show us your filmography shelf. Screenshot it. Share it. What's your legacy?"

Use a hashtag: #MyFramewarShelf or #FramewarLegacy

**Retweet and Amplify:**
Every single shelf screenshot gets retweeted. Add context: "This player championed 2D until the bitter end. Respect." "This shelf is all tentpoles and Oscars. Absolute powerhouse." "This player made one film that lost $40M and then never recovered. A cautionary tale."

**Community Spotlights:**
Weekly "Studio of the Week" feature on Twitter and Discord. Interview the player (via DM or text Q&A): "What was your strategy? What's the film you're most proud of? What would you do differently?"

**TikTok Duets:**
Encourage players to post their shelf on TikTok with the game's emotional score playing. Duet and react: "This shelf is a JOURNEY."

**Steam Reviews as Marketing:**
Positive reviews that tell stories (not just "good game") are marketing gold. When a reviewer writes "I bankrupted my studio defending 2D animation and I regret nothing," screenshot that and share it. With permission, obviously.

---

## 11. BUDGET ALLOCATION (ESTIMATED)

Assuming a $50K-$150K total marketing budget (adjust based on actual studio resources).

### Breakdown

**Asset Creation (20% - $10K-$30K):**
- Trailer production (editing, sound design, music licensing)
- Screenshot curation and editing
- GIF creation (10-15 high-quality loops)
- Press kit design
- Steam capsule art finalization

**Paid Advertising (15% - $7.5K-$22.5K):**
- Steam visibility campaigns (optional, Steam's algorithm is organic-first but targeted ads can help)
- Reddit promoted posts (one or two strategic posts on r/pcgaming, r/tycoon during launch week)
- Twitter/X promoted tweets (boost the announcement trailer, boost the launch day post)
- **AVOID Facebook/Instagram ads** — wrong audience, low ROI for indie PC games

**Influencer Outreach (10% - $5K-$15K):**
- Not paying for coverage (most YouTubers covering management sims do it for free if they like the game)
- Budget is for: sending physical press kits to top-tier influencers (optional but nice), paying for a PR firm to handle outreach (optional), or offering small honorariums to niche creators ($100-$500) who wouldn't normally cover games but have the right audience (animation YouTubers, film essayists)

**Events and Festivals (20% - $10K-$30K):**
- Steam Next Fest (free to participate, but budget for dev time and potential livestream costs)
- PAX booth (if doing in-person demo): $5K-$15K for booth space, materials, travel
- Day of the Devs showcase (free if accepted, but budget for travel if in-person)
- Submit fees for awards (IGF, IndieCade, BAFTA): $500-$2K total

**Community Building (10% - $5K-$15K):**
- Discord server hosting (Nitro for better server features): $100/year
- Merchandise for giveaways (stickers, shirts with the filmography shelf design): $1K-$3K
- Community manager part-time hire (if needed): $5K-$10K for 3-6 months

**Press and PR (15% - $7.5K-$22.5K):**
- Hire a PR firm (optional but effective): $5K-$15K for a 3-month campaign
- Press kit hosting and distribution tools
- Email outreach tools (if doing large-scale press blasts)

**Contingency and Misc (10% - $5K-$15K):**
- Last-minute trailer revisions
- Emergency bug-fix PR (if launch is rough)
- Unexpected opportunities (a major streamer wants to cover the game but needs a custom build, a festival invites you last-minute, etc.)

### ROI Expectations

**Conservative (50K budget):**
- 200K wishlists → 50K launch month sales at $20 = $1M gross revenue (Steam takes 30%, so $700K net)
- ROI: $700K net - $200K dev budget - $50K marketing = $450K profit
- **7x return on marketing spend**

**Optimistic (150K budget):**
- 400K wishlists → 120K launch month sales at $20 = $2.4M gross ($1.68M net)
- ROI: $1.68M net - $200K dev - $150K marketing = $1.33M profit
- **8.8x return on marketing spend**

Management sims have long tails. A successful launch (50K-120K Month 1 sales) grows to 200K-500K lifetime with sales, updates, and word-of-mouth.

---

## 12. LAUNCH WEEK CRISIS MANAGEMENT

### The Reality

No launch is perfect. Here's the playbook for when things go wrong.

### Scenario 1: Negative Reviews (Sub-70% Positive on Steam)

**Diagnosis:**
Read every negative review. Sort by "most helpful." Identify patterns. Is it bugs? Is it a core mechanic that's unfun? Is it a mismatched expectation (players thought it was real-time, it's turn-based)?

**Response:**
- **If it's bugs:** Patch immediately. Post a public statement on Steam Community Hub: "We've identified [X issues]. Patch deploying within 48 hours. Thank you for your patience."
- **If it's a design issue:** Acknowledge it. "We're hearing feedback that [X] feels frustrating. We're evaluating solutions. Stay tuned."
- **If it's mismatched expectations:** Update the Steam description to clarify. Add a note to the top of the page: "Please note: FRAMEWAR is a turn-based management sim, not a real-time game."

**Do NOT:**
Argue with reviewers. Dismiss criticism as "they don't understand the vision." Get defensive. Silence is better than a bad response.

### Scenario 2: Influencers Aren't Covering It

**Diagnosis:**
Did the outreach emails land? Did the builds go out on time? Are management sim YouTubers already saturated with other releases?

**Response:**
- Follow up with personalized emails: "Hey [Name], just wanted to make sure the key landed. No pressure, but if you have time, we'd love your thoughts."
- Offer to hop on a call and walk them through the game (some YouTubers appreciate this)
- Pivot to smaller creators (100K-500K subs instead of 1M+). They often have better engagement rates anyway.

### Scenario 3: Sales Are Below Target (Week 1)

**Diagnosis:**
Check Steam's internal traffic data (if available). Are people visiting the page but not buying? Or is traffic low?

**Response:**
- **Low traffic:** Visibility problem. Increase social media posting frequency. Deploy paid ads on Steam. Reach out to press who didn't cover at launch.
- **High traffic, low conversion:** Store page problem. The capsule image or description isn't converting. Run A/B tests on capsule images (Steam allows this). Revise the short description.

**Do NOT:**
Panic discount. A week-one 50%-off sale signals desperation. Stick to the 10% launch discount (if planned) and ride it out. Management sims are slow burns.

### Scenario 4: A Major Streamer Covers It and Has a Bad Take

**Diagnosis:**
A big-name streamer plays FRAMEWAR for 30 minutes, doesn't understand the systems, says "this is boring," and their 500K viewers believe them.

**Response:**
- Politely offer to send a message or comment (if they allow community interaction): "Hey! Looks like [X mechanic] wasn't clear. If you give it another shot, here's what we recommend trying..."
- Do NOT publicly argue or criticize them. That looks terrible.
- Focus energy on smaller creators who "get it." Their positive coverage will balance the narrative.

### Scenario 5: Everything Goes Perfectly (Nice Problem to Have)

**Diagnosis:**
Reviews are "Very Positive." Streamers love it. Sales exceed projections.

**Response:**
- Keep posting. Ride the momentum. Share every positive review, every streamer clip, every player screenshot.
- Plan post-launch content faster. Strike while iron is hot.
- Thank the community publicly and often. Gratitude builds loyalty.

## 14. RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: The Hook Doesn't Land

**Symptom:** Announcement trailer gets lukewarm response. Wishlists under 5K in Week 1.

**Mitigation:**
Revisit the trailer. Is the greenlight GIF clear? Is the production pipeline board legible? Does the "run your own Pixar" line resonate? Test with focus groups (Discord, Reddit, Twitter polls). If the hook is weak, delay announcement and rebuild it. A weak hook kills everything downstream.

### Risk 2: Market Saturation

**Symptom:** Two other management sims launch the same month. FRAMEWAR gets drowned out.

**Mitigation:**
Monitor release calendars. If Cities: Skylines 2 or Manor Lords or another huge management sim is launching the same week, MOVE THE DATE. Indie games cannot compete with AAA or mega-indie launches for attention. Launch in a quiet window.

### Risk 3: Technical Disaster at Launch

**Symptom:** Game-breaking bugs. Crashes. Save corruption. Steam reviews tank.

**Mitigation:**
Closed beta testing is non-negotiable. 50-100 players for 4-6 weeks before launch. Catch the bugs early. On launch day, have the dev team on standby. First patch should be ready to deploy within 24 hours if needed.

### Risk 4: The Film Enthusiast Audience Doesn't Show Up

**Symptom:** Management sim players love it, but the film Twitter / animation community doesn't care.

**Mitigation:**
Lean harder into the historical authenticity. Publish blog posts about the real history of 2D's death. Partner with animation historians (reach out to Cartoon Brew, Animation Magazine). If the story is told right, the film audience will come. But if outreach fails, accept it — the management sim audience alone can carry the game to profitability.

### Risk 5: Post-Launch Burnout

**Symptom:** Dev team exhausted. Community management drops off. Updates slow.

**Mitigation:**
Plan post-launch rest. Week 2 post-launch, the team takes 3-5 days off (after the initial patch stabilizes). Hire or recruit community moderators for Discord so the team isn't answering every question. Long-term sustainability matters more than grinding through Month 1.

---

## 15. THE "OH SHIT" PIVOT (IF LAUNCH FAILS)

### If Month 1 Sales Are Sub-20K

This is below break-even. The game is not dead, but it needs intervention.

**Immediate Actions:**

**Re-evaluate the Steam Page:**
The capsule image is the #1 driver of wishlists. If it's not working, replace it. Test 3-5 variations. Pick the one with the highest click-through rate.

**Deep Discount (Month 2-3):**
30-40% off during Steam sale events. Loss-leader strategy: get the game into more hands, hope word-of-mouth kicks in.

**Content Update:**
Release a free content update (new film concepts, new rival studio, QOL improvements). Relaunch the marketing campaign around the update. "FRAMEWAR 1.1 is here. Here's what's new."

**Influencer Blitz:**
Offer keys to ANYONE with a YouTube/Twitch following. No minimums. Get the game in front of as many eyes as possible.

**Pivot to Different Audience:**
If the management sim audience didn't bite, go HARD on the film enthusiast angle. Reach out to every animation podcast, every film essayist, every Letterboxd power user. Change the pitch from "management sim" to "interactive documentary about the CG revolution."

**Last Resort: Bundle Strategy:**
Partner with Humble Bundle, Fanatical, or other bundle platforms. Sell 50K-100K copies at $3-$5 per copy in a bundle. Low per-unit revenue, but it floods the market with players who might leave positive reviews and generate long-tail sales.

### If Month 1 Sales Are 100K+

This is a hit. Different problems.

**Immediate Actions:**

**Scale Up Community Management:**
Hire a full-time community manager. Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Steam forums — someone needs to own this.

**Accelerate DLC/Expansion Timeline:**
If the game is selling, monetize the success. Move the expansion (Streaming Wars, International Studio) from Year 2 to Month 6-9.

**Merchandise:**
Players will buy shirts with the filmography shelf design, posters with the production pipeline board, vinyl soundtracks. Open a merch store.

**Press for Awards:**
Submit to every indie game award. IGF, IndieCade, BAFTA, The Game Awards (indie category). Winning any of these extends the game's media cycle by 6-12 months.

**Port Strategy:**
Success on PC justifies console ports (Switch, possibly PS5/Xbox). Mobile (iPad) is also viable given the touch-friendly interface. Start port planning at Month 3 post-launch.

---

## 16. THE FINAL WORD (HYPE'S MANIFESTO)

### Marketing Is Not a Phase

The best game in the world sells zero copies if nobody knows it exists. I've seen it happen. I worked on a game that was fucking brilliant — tight loop, deep systems, emotional core — and it sold 200 copies because the studio started marketing four weeks before launch. Four weeks. For a game that took three years to make.

Marketing is not the cherry on top. It's not the thing you do after the game is done. Marketing starts on day one. The day you commit to making FRAMEWAR, you start thinking about the hook. The GIF. The five-second scroll-stop moment. The Steam capsule image. The comparable games. The target audience. The trailer structure. All of it.

### Show the GAME, Not the Features

Nobody cares that FRAMEWAR has "a six-phase production pipeline with procedural Film DNA scoring and a hidden Studio Soul meter." They care that they can greenlight a hand-drawn passion project about grief in 2003, watch it win the Oscar, and see it sit on a shelf next to their CG tentpoles. SHOW THAT. Show the moment the Oscar trophy appears. Show the filmography shelf. Show the storyboard room glowing at night. The mechanics are the engine. The moments are the marketing.

### The Hook Is Everything

Five seconds. That's how long you have. A player is scrolling Steam's New and Trending. They see your capsule image. Do they click, or do they scroll past? The difference between 10K wishlists and 200K wishlists is that five-second decision, multiplied by 100,000 players. The hook is not "nice to have." The hook is survival.

For FRAMEWAR, the hook is: **The production pipeline board with film cards sliding through phases. The corkboard with thumbtacks. The warm studio at night. The Oscar trophy on the shelf. "Run your own Pixar."** That is the entire pitch. Everything else is supporting material.

### Start Building the Audience NOW

Not six months before launch. Not three months before launch. Now. The day you commit to the game. Set up the Steam page (even if it's not public yet). Create the social media accounts. Start posting concept art. Start posting design threads. Start building the list of journalists who will care. The players who wishlist 18 months before launch are the players who buy on day one and leave positive reviews in the first 48 hours. Those first 48 hours determine whether Steam's algorithm makes you visible or buries you.

### What's the GIF?

If you can't answer that question, you're not ready to announce. The GIF is the scroll-stop moment in 3-5 seconds. It's the visual hook that makes someone stop, watch, and click. For FRAMEWAR, it's the greenlight stamp. The card sliding to the pipeline board. The box office numbers counting up. The Oscar trophy appearing. Build those moments. Make them beautiful. Make them legible. Then deploy them everywhere.

### This Plan Is a Living Document

Timelines shift. Budgets change. A pandemic happens. A competitor launches. The market moves. This plan is not scripture. It's a roadmap. If something isn't working (the announcement trailer gets 5K views instead of 50K), pivot. Test new capsule images. Rewrite the pitch. Find a different angle. Marketing is not "set it and forget it." It's constant iteration. Read the data. Listen to the audience. Adjust.

### The Filmography Shelf Is the Score

Most games have a number at the end. Score: 487,392. Revenue: $15M. Prestige: 87/100. FRAMEWAR has a shelf. Eight to ten film boxes, glowing under spotlights, with Oscar statues next to some of them. That shelf is the player's autobiography. That shelf is what they screenshot and share. That shelf is the marketing. Build everything around that image.

### We Do Not Say "The Game Will Speak for Itself"

No it won't. The game is a file on a server until someone downloads it. And nobody downloads it unless they know it exists. Marketing is not hype. Marketing is clarity. It's answering the question: "Why should I care about this?" in five seconds. If the game is good, marketing amplifies that. If the game is weak, marketing can't save it — but even a masterpiece dies in silence without marketing.

FRAMEWAR is good. The loop is tight. The systems are deep. The heart is real. Now we make sure people know it exists. That's the job. That's the plan. Let's build the audience from day one, not day last.
