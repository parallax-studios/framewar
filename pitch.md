# FRAMEWAR — Game Pitch Document

**Game Dev Tycoon meets The Movies meets the Pixar documentary "The Pixar Story"**

*An animation studio simulation set during the CG revolution, where you greenlight films, build creative teams, and fight for box office dominance in the era when computer graphics killed hand-drawn animation and two mega-studios went to war.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Run an animation studio during the Pixar vs. DreamWorks arms race — greenlight films, hire star voice casts, push CG technology or die defending 2D, and survive the most ruthless creative industry on earth.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "I greenlit a hand-drawn epic about grief in 2003. It won Best Animated Feature. It also bankrupted my studio. I'd do it again."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: It's 2004. Your rendering farm is overheating. Your lead animator just quit to join Pixar. Your celebrity voice actor is demanding a $12 million renegotiation mid-production because his last live-action film bombed and his agent smells desperation. And on the storyboard wall in front of you — pinned with actual thumbtacks on a corkboard interface — is the animatic for your magnum opus: a CG film about a lonely lighthouse keeper that your focus test groups scored at 42 but your director swears is going to change animation forever.

Do you gut the third act for a fart joke and a celebrity sidekick? Or do you trust the vision?

The camera pulls back. You're looking at the full studio — the rendering farm monitors flickering green and red, the storyboard room with hundreds of pinned drawings, the voice recording booth where a name-brand actor is reading lines, the box office tracking board from your last release still glowing with numbers. This is not a spreadsheet. This is a living, breathing animation studio. And every wall tells a story about a film that almost didn't get made.

That is a trailer. That is a Steam capsule image. That is the five-second hook that stops every Game Dev Tycoon and cinema-obsessed player dead in their scroll.

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

**30-second loop**: Navigate your studio floor. Check on active productions — review storyboard progress, watch dailies in the screening room, approve or reject animation shots, manage personnel crises. Every click is a micro-decision: approve this shot that's technically brilliant but emotionally flat, or send it back for revision and blow the schedule by two weeks?

**5-minute loop**: Manage a single production quarter. Allocate your finite studio resources (animators, render farm hours, voice recording sessions, story room time) across 1-3 simultaneous films in various stages of their 3-4 year pipelines. Respond to events: a rival studio announces a film with the same premise as yours, a key animator has a creative breakthrough, the MPAA rating board flags your film's villain as too scary for kids. Make strategic greenlight decisions on new pitches from your development slate.

**Session loop (30-60 minutes)**: Shepherd a film from greenlight through development, pre-production, production, post-production, marketing, and release. Watch box office tracking roll in week by week. Navigate awards season. Process the financial and reputational aftermath. Each completed film reshapes your studio's identity — its reputation score across axes like PRESTIGE, COMMERCIAL APPEAL, TECHNICAL INNOVATION, and ARTISTIC COURAGE. That identity determines what talent wants to work with you, what projects get pitched to you, and how the industry perceives you. Then greenlight the next film. The cycle begins again.

**Campaign arc (8-15 hours)**: Play through the full era from 1995 to 2010. Witness the death of 2D animation, the rise of CG, the birth of the Best Animated Feature Oscar, the DreamWorks-Pixar rivalry, and the moment when everyone realized animated films could gross a billion dollars. Your studio's legacy is written across a filmography — a shelf of movies that the game's procedural critics and audiences will remember, reference, and compare. Did you build the next Pixar? The next DreamWorks? Or something entirely your own?

### Core Mechanics

1. **The Greenlight Table**: Your central decision hub. Film pitches arrive as one-page concept documents pinned to a corkboard. Each pitch has visible attributes — CONCEPT ORIGINALITY, AUDIENCE BREADTH, TECHNICAL AMBITION, SEQUEL POTENTIAL — and hidden risks. You assign a director, a target budget, a release window, and a technology approach (2D traditional, early CG, cutting-edge CG, hybrid). Greenlighting a film commits 3-4 years of studio resources. You can run 1-3 films simultaneously depending on studio size. This is the decision that defines everything downstream.

2. **The Production Pipeline**: Every greenlit film moves through six distinct phases — DEVELOPMENT (story and script), PRE-PRODUCTION (storyboards, animatics, voice casting), PRODUCTION (animation, modeling, rendering), POST-PRODUCTION (lighting, effects, compositing, sound), MARKETING (trailers, press tours, premiere events), and RELEASE (box office tracking, critic reviews, audience word-of-mouth). Each phase has its own mini-management layer. Rush a phase and quality drops. Over-invest and you blow the budget. The pipeline is the spine of the game — a visual, left-to-right progression board mounted on your studio wall that shows every film's status at a glance.

3. **The Talent Engine**: Your studio is only as good as its people. Hire and manage four talent categories — DIRECTORS (with creative visions, ego levels, and track records), ANIMATORS (with speed/quality tradeoffs and style specializations), STORY ARTISTS (who generate the narrative quality of your films), and VOICE ACTORS (celebrities with star power ratings, salary demands, scheduling conflicts, and audience draw). Each person is a simulated agent with morale, loyalty, and a career arc. Poach Pixar's best? Watch DreamWorks poach yours. A legendary director with an uncompromising vision will make your best film — or your most expensive disaster.

4. **The Technology Tree (The Render Race)**: CG technology evolves throughout the campaign. A branching tech tree lets you invest studio R&D budget into specific rendering capabilities — SUBSURFACE SCATTERING (realistic skin), FUR AND HAIR SIMULATION, FLUID DYNAMICS, FACIAL RIGGING FIDELITY, CROWD SYSTEMS, GLOBAL ILLUMINATION. Each breakthrough visibly improves your films' ANIMATION QUALITY score and opens new visual possibilities. But here's the tension: you can also invest in 2D INNOVATION — digital ink-and-paint, hybrid 2D/3D compositing, stylized rendering. The market says 2D is dead after 2003. The market might be wrong. Or it might destroy you.

5. **The Box Office Gauntlet**: When a film releases, you don't just see a number. You experience a four-week box office run with weekly drops, competition from rival releases, critic review aggregation (a Rotten Tomatoes-style system called "The Projector Score"), audience word-of-mouth propagation, and cultural moment tracking. A film can be a slow-burn hit or a frontloaded flop. Awards season adds another layer — the Academy Awards Best Animated Feature (newly created in your timeline in 2001) becomes a prestige arms race. Winning an Oscar doesn't just feel good. It changes your studio's talent magnetism, your next film's marketing budget efficiency, and your leverage with distributors.

6. **Film DNA System**: Every film you produce is procedurally assembled from scored attributes — STORY DEPTH, ANIMATION QUALITY, HUMOR, HEART, SPECTACLE, VOICE CAST APPEAL, ORIGINALITY, and REWATCHABILITY. These scores emerge from your production decisions: who you hired, how much time you gave each phase, what technology you used, whether you let the director's vision survive or focus-tested it into blandness. The interaction between these scores determines critic response, audience response, box office performance, and award chances. A film with 9 SPECTACLE but 3 STORY is a $400 million DreamWorks-style hit. A film with 9 STORY, 9 HEART, and 6 SPECTACLE is a Pixar-caliber masterpiece. A film with 4 across the board is Shark Tale.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner greenlights whatever sounds cool, hires the most famous voice actors, and wonders why their studio is bankrupt by 2003. They over-invest in one film and under-resource the others. They chase every trend.

An expert reads the market three years ahead — they know that in 2001, the Academy Award creates a prestige race, so they have an award-caliber film in the pipeline timed for a 2002 release. They balance their slate: one commercial tentpole funding one artistic risk. They understand the Talent Engine deeply — they know that a mid-tier director with a perfect vision-to-ego ratio will outperform a legendary director having a crisis. They invest in technology strategically, timing breakthroughs to coincide with productions that showcase them. They manage the Production Pipeline like a conductor — knowing exactly when to push a phase and when to let it breathe. And they understand the Film DNA System well enough to know that HEART multiplies STORY in the review algorithm, that VOICE CAST APPEAL has diminishing returns above 7, and that ORIGINALITY is the highest-variance stat in the game.

The 50-hour player isn't just running a studio. They're curating a filmography. They're thinking about legacy.

### Unique Mechanic

**The Innovation vs. Formula Tension** — the game's entire strategic spine. Every decision maps to this axis. Pushing CG boundaries is expensive and risky but yields breakout hits. Following proven formulas is safe but invites diminishing returns as audiences get bored. Championing 2D animation when the market has moved on is commercially suicidal — unless you make something so extraordinary that you create a counter-narrative. No other management sim makes the *artistic courage of your decisions* the primary strategic variable. Game Dev Tycoon tracks genre/topic combos. The Movies tracks star power. FRAMEWAR tracks whether you had the guts to make the film that nobody asked for — and whether the world was ready for it.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the budgets and box office numbers, FRAMEWAR is about the cost of making something beautiful in a system that rewards making something profitable.**

Every animator who ever stayed until 3 AM fixing a lighting pass on a scene that lasts four seconds knows this tension. Every director who fought a studio executive to keep the quiet moment in the third act instead of replacing it with an action sequence. Every story artist who pinned a drawing to a board knowing it was the best work of their life and watched it get cut for runtime.

FRAMEWAR is about the people who make the magic — and the machine that consumes them. It asks: can you build a studio that makes great art AND survives? Or does one always eat the other? The answer, the game whispers, depends on what you're willing to sacrifice.

### The World

The world is Hollywood, 1995 to 2010 — but refracted through the specific, strange, beautiful lens of the animation industry. This is a world where a film takes four years to make and can be killed in a single weekend. Where technology that didn't exist when you started production is obsolete by the time you finish. Where a roomful of artists can spend eighteen months on a film that a twelve-year-old will watch once on a plane and forget.

The wound of this world is the death of 2D animation. In 1994, The Lion King grossed $968 million and hand-drawn animation was king. By 2004, it was commercially extinct — murdered not by audience indifference but by an industry that confused "Toy Story made money because it was CG" with "Toy Story made money because it was extraordinary." The scar is still visible. Every 2D animator who was laid off. Every studio that shuttered its hand-drawn division. Every film that was greenlit not because it had a story worth telling but because it had fur that could be rendered.

Your studio exists in this world. The corkboards on your walls are covered with concept art. The screening room smells like stale coffee. The render farm hums all night. And somewhere in the building, someone is drawing something that might change a child's life — if you can figure out how to get it made.

### Player's Emotional Arc

**Year One (1995-1998)**: Wonder. The CG revolution is beginning. Everything feels possible. You're small, scrappy, and hungry. Your first film is modest but it's yours. The studio feels like a family.

**Year Three (1999-2002)**: Ambition. You've tasted success. The studio is growing. The Best Animated Feature Oscar is announced and suddenly animation is legitimate. You want to win it. But growth means politics, bigger budgets, higher stakes, and the first time you have to choose between the film your director believes in and the film the market wants.

**Year Five (2003-2005)**: Crisis. 2D animation dies. Studios collapse. Your rival releases a blockbuster the same weekend as your passion project. A production spirals over budget. You lay off artists for the first time. The fun is gone. This is survival.

**Year Seven (2006-2008)**: Reckoning. You look at your filmography shelf. Some of those films are masterpieces. Some are compromises. Some are both. The studio has an identity now — one you built through a hundred small decisions. Was it worth it?

**Year Ten (2009-2010)**: Legacy. The era is ending. A new generation of studios is rising. Your final film is in production. What do you want it to say? What do you want the shelf to look like when it's done? The game ends not with a score but with a retrospective — a film festival screening your complete works, with procedurally generated critic commentary on your studio's legacy.

### The Story Hook

**Who are you willing to become to make something that lasts?**

Every studio in FRAMEWAR has a soul — and the game tracks it. The STUDIO SOUL is an invisible axis between ARTIST and EXECUTIVE, shifted by every decision you make. Cancel a troubled production? Executive. Greenlight a risky passion project with no market data? Artist. Neither is wrong. Both have costs.

The narrative pull is not a single question but a career-long tension: the player begins as a dreamer and the industry tries to make them a pragmatist. The game never judges you for becoming one. But it makes sure you feel every step of the transformation. The most devastating moment in FRAMEWAR isn't a bankruptcy. It's the moment you realize you greenlit a sequel not because you had a story to tell, but because you needed the revenue. And it worked. And you're not sure how to feel about that.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Management sim and tycoon game players aged 20-40 who have put hundreds of hours into Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Planet Coaster, or Software Inc. They love systems, optimization, and building something from nothing. They are the Steam audience that keeps management sims in the top sellers. They hang out on r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, and management sim Discord servers. They will wishlist this the moment they see the storyboard room interface.

**Secondary**: Film and animation enthusiasts who may not be core gamers. People who watched "The Pixar Story" documentary, who read Ed Catmull's "Creativity, Inc.," who have opinions about why DreamWorks never matched Pixar's consistency. They play games casually but a game about their obsession — the inner workings of an animation studio — is an instant hook. This is the crossover audience, the one that turns FRAMEWAR from a niche sim into a cultural conversation.

**Tertiary**: Creative professionals — animators, filmmakers, game developers — who will see themselves in the game's depiction of creative production. They are a small audience but an incredibly vocal one. They will make the TikToks. They will write the essays. They will be the game's evangelists.

### Comparable Games

1. **Game Dev Tycoon** meets **The Movies (2005)**: Game Dev Tycoon's accessible studio management and procedural product creation married to The Movies' cinematic production pipeline and visual studio environment. But where Game Dev Tycoon abstracts everything into sliders and where The Movies drowned in micromanagement, FRAMEWAR finds the sweet spot — meaningful decisions at every level without busywork.

2. **Two Point Hospital** meets **Creativity, Inc.**: Two Point's charming, diegetic management interface (the studio IS the UI) combined with a genuine emotional core about the human cost of creative production. The humor of Two Point, the heart of Pixar.

3. **Software Inc.** meets **Awards Season**: Software Inc.'s deep business simulation — hiring, office layout, product development, competitor AI — but set in the high-drama world of Hollywood animation where the Academy Awards create a prestige meta-game that no tech sim has.

4. **Football Manager** meets **Hollywood**: Football Manager's "you never play the match, but you FEEL every goal" philosophy applied to filmmaking. You never watch your film play on screen. But when the box office numbers roll in on opening weekend, when the Projector Score aggregates, when the Oscar nomination list is read — you feel every frame.

5. **Cultist Simulator** meets **Pixar**: Cultist Simulator's card-on-table, tactile, mysterious interface aesthetic — pinned storyboards, physical corkboards, diegetic documents — applied to animation production. Information as physical objects in a workspace you inhabit.

### Unique Selling Proposition

There is no animation studio management sim. Zero. The closest is The Movies (2005, Lionhead Studios), which is 20 years old and focused on live-action. Game Dev Tycoon is the obvious comparison but it abstracts creative production into genre/topic combos and sliders. FRAMEWAR is the first game to simulate the specific, fascinating, dramatic world of animated feature production — the four-year pipelines, the technology arms race, the voice casting circus, the awards politics, and the central creative tension between art and commerce.

The hook writes itself: "Run your own Pixar." Five words. Instant comprehension. Instant desire. The specificity of the era — the CG revolution, the death of 2D, the birth of the animation Oscar — gives it a historical texture that generic studio sims lack. This is not "make a movie." This is "make animated history."

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary and perfect. Management sims are a Steam-dominant genre. The mouse-driven interface (clicking through storyboard rooms, dragging personnel assignments, reviewing production boards) is native to PC. Steam's tagging system will surface this to every Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, and Software Inc. wishlist. The management sim community on Steam is loyal, vocal, and desperate for fresh settings.

**Nintendo Switch**: Strong secondary. Management sims perform well on Switch (Two Point Hospital, Game Dev Tycoon). The session length (30-60 minutes per meaningful arc) fits portable play. Touch screen interface maps naturally to the corkboard/storyboard UI.

**iPad**: Sleeper hit potential. The tactile, touch-native interface (pinning storyboards, dragging talent cards, tapping through dailies) is almost designed for tablet. Premium mobile management sim audience is underserved and hungry.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (non-negotiable)

1. **The Diegetic Studio Interface**: The entire game UI is the studio itself. No abstract menus. Your storyboard room is where you review film concepts. Your render farm is a wall of monitors showing processing status. Your screening room is where you watch dailies and see audience test reactions. Your lobby has a shelf displaying your released films with their box art, awards, and lifetime gross. The studio grows physically as you expand — new wings, new screening rooms, a bigger render farm. The player should feel like they WORK here.

2. **The Production Pipeline Board**: The left-to-right visual pipeline — DEVELOPMENT through RELEASE — displayed as a physical wall-mounted board in the studio. Every film is a card moving through phases. Click into a phase to manage it. This is the game's strategic spine. It must be immediately readable and deeply interactive.

3. **The Film DNA and Procedural Reception System**: Films are not random outcomes. They are the emergent result of hundreds of player decisions — who directed, who animated, what technology was used, how much time each phase got, whether you interfered with the director's vision. The Film DNA (STORY DEPTH, ANIMATION QUALITY, HUMOR, HEART, SPECTACLE, VOICE CAST APPEAL, ORIGINALITY, REWATCHABILITY) feeds into a procedural reception engine that generates critic reviews, audience word-of-mouth curves, box office trajectories, and award chances. The player must feel that their decisions CAUSED the outcome — no randomness without legibility.

4. **The Innovation vs. Formula Axis**: Every major decision nudges the studio's creative identity. A visible reputation system across four axes — PRESTIGE (#C4A84D, gold), COMMERCIAL APPEAL (#2ECC71, green), TECHNICAL INNOVATION (#3498DB, blue), and ARTISTIC COURAGE (#9B59B6, purple) — shapes what talent approaches you, what projects get pitched, and how the industry reacts to your films. These four colors are the game's visual identity, appearing as accent lights in your studio, as colored pins on the corkboard, and as the four quadrants of your studio reputation display.

5. **The Era Simulation (1995-2010)**: The game world is not static. The CG technology frontier advances. 2D animation's commercial viability collapses. The Best Animated Feature Oscar is created in 2001. Rival studios (procedurally generated, inspired by but legally distinct from Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky, etc.) release films that compete with yours for box office and awards. Voice actor salaries inflate. Audience expectations evolve. The era is a character — it pushes back, creates opportunities, and closes doors. Playing in 1996 should feel fundamentally different from playing in 2006.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **Studio Culture System**: Employee satisfaction, crunch mechanics, and workplace culture as a management layer. Push your team too hard and quality rises short-term but attrition spikes. Foster a healthy culture and you attract top talent but production is slower. Reflects the real animation industry's reckoning with crunch — mechanically meaningful, not just flavor.

2. **The Sequel Machine**: A dedicated system for sequels and franchises. Sequels are cheaper and lower-risk but score lower on ORIGINALITY. Franchise fatigue accumulates. The temptation of sequel revenue vs. the creative cost is the game's central tension made concrete. A franchise meter tracks audience goodwill — push too many sequels and it craters.

3. **The Press Tour**: A mini-game layer for film marketing. Choose which festivals to attend (Cannes, Toronto, Sundance Animation Spotlight). Decide how much of the film to reveal in trailers. Manage press interviews where your director might go off-script. Marketing spend vs. organic buzz as competing strategies.

4. **Director's Cut Mode**: After a film releases, an option to revisit it. Restore cut scenes. Fix the third act you compromised. Release a Director's Cut that might find a new audience — or be seen as self-indulgent. A mechanic about artistic regret and second chances.

5. **Industry Events**: Procedurally generated industry disruptions — a technological breakthrough by a rival, a box office bomb that reshapes audience expectations, a voice actor scandal, a distribution deal collapse. Events that force reactive decision-making and prevent optimal play from becoming rote.

6. **Modding Support / Custom Eras**: Allow players to create custom scenarios — different time periods (the Disney Renaissance, the modern streaming wars), different starting conditions, custom rival studios. The management sim community thrives on modding.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Actually watching the films**: The player never sees their film play as a movie. You see storyboards, animatics, dailies, and individual shots — but the "film" is an abstraction. Attempting to procedurally generate watchable animated content would consume the entire budget for a gimmick.

- **Live-action productions**: The game is specifically about animation. The specificity is the strength. Adding live-action dilutes the identity and doubles the system complexity.

- **Online multiplayer studio competition**: The era simulation already provides competitive pressure through AI rivals. Multiplayer would require balancing that undermines the single-player narrative arc.

- **Voice acting mini-games**: You hire voice actors and see their impact on VOICE CAST APPEAL. You do not direct recording sessions as a rhythm game or dialogue mini-game. That's a different game.

- **Real celebrity or studio names**: All talent, studios, and films are fictional or procedurally generated. The game evokes the era without requiring licensing. Your rival is not "Pixar" — it is "Luminos Animation," a studio with Pixar's DNA that the player will immediately recognize and respect.

- **Studio architecture simulation**: You see your studio grow but you do not design floor plans. This is not an architecture game. The studio layout is pre-designed and expands narratively.

## KEY ART / MOOD DIRECTION

**Hero Image**: A warmly lit animation studio at night, seen from above at a slight angle. The render farm glows blue-white in one corner (#3498DB). The storyboard room is bathed in warm yellow lamplight (#C4A84D), corkboards covered in pinned drawings. A screening room in the back shows a projected animatic — silhouettes of artists watching. In the foreground, a desk with a greenlight document, a coffee cup, and a small Oscar statuette. Through the windows, a city skyline at dusk — Los Angeles, 2003. The feeling is: warmth, ambition, late nights, creative purpose. Think the art direction of Unpacking meets the tonal warmth of a Pixar "making-of" documentary.

**Color Palette**:
- Studio Warmth (primary background): `#2C1810` deep brown, `#F5E6D0` warm cream
- Prestige Gold: `#C4A84D` — awards, quality indicators, premium talent
- Commercial Green: `#2ECC71` — box office numbers, revenue, market performance
- Innovation Blue: `#3498DB` — technology, render farm, CG breakthroughs
- Courage Purple: `#9B59B6` — artistic risk, originality, auteur decisions
- Crisis Red: `#E74C3C` — budget overruns, production problems, box office bombs
- Storyboard Cream: `#FFF8E7` — the paper color of pinned storyboards and concept art
- Render Farm Glow: `#1ABC9C` teal — the ambient light of working computers at night

**UI Mood**: Diegetic and tactile. Corkboards with actual pushpins. Production schedules as physical whiteboards with dry-erase marker aesthetics. Film status cards that look like index cards with handwritten notes. The render farm as a wall of small monitors with progress bars. Box office numbers displayed on a wall-mounted LED ticker. The Oscar shelf as a physical glass case in your studio lobby. Everything you interact with exists in the world. The management sim genre is drowning in flat UI panels — FRAMEWAR's corkboard-and-screening-room interface is the visual hook that separates it from every competitor.

**Audio Mood**: A warm, jazzy score that shifts with the era — mid-90s optimism (bright, Gershwin-influenced orchestration) through early-2000s intensity (driving, percussive, the sound of a render farm at 2 AM) to late-2000s reflection (quieter, piano-driven, looking back at what you built). Diegetic sound design: the hum of the render farm, the scratch of pencil on storyboard paper, the whir of a film projector in the screening room, the eruption of applause (or silence) at a premiere. When your film wins Best Animated Feature, the score swells with a full orchestra. When it bombs, the studio is quiet. Just the render farm humming. Waiting for the next one.

## OPEN QUESTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

### Design Questions [REED]
- What is the right number of simultaneous film productions before the management becomes overwhelming? Two feels thin; four feels like spreadsheet hell. Three is the hypothesis.
- How granular should the Production Pipeline phases be? Each phase needs enough decisions to feel meaningful but not enough to become tedious. Target: 3-5 key decisions per phase per film.
- How does the Technology Tree interact with the production timeline? If a tech breakthrough completes mid-production, can you retroactively apply it? That's a fascinating decision point but could be exploitative.
- What's the right length for a box office run? Four weeks with weekly reporting is the hypothesis. Long enough to feel the trajectory, short enough to not stall the game.
- How aggressive should rival AI studios be? Too passive and there's no competitive pressure. Too aggressive and the game feels unfair. The rival system needs to be readable — the player should be able to anticipate rival release windows and plan around them.
- Does the Innovation vs. Formula axis need to be visible or hidden? Visible risks min-maxing. Hidden risks feeling arbitrary. Hypothesis: visible but with fuzzy thresholds.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]
- How do we make the player care about their studio's identity without explicit narrative? The filmography shelf, the studio reputation display, the talent who choose to work with you — these are narrative delivery mechanisms. Are they enough?
- Where is the emotional climax of the campaign? The hypothesis is the final film — the one you greenlight knowing it's your last. But does the game need a more structured narrative arc, or does emergence carry it?
- How do we write procedurally generated film concepts that feel authored? Each pitch needs to feel like it was written by a passionate creative, not a random noun-adjective generator. The concept generation system needs authorial voice.
- What's the right tone for the era's darkest moment — the mass layoffs of 2D animators? The game should not flinch from this, but it also should not be exploitative. The player should feel the weight of the decision to close their 2D division — or the cost of keeping it open.
- Do individual employees need personal stories, or is the studio itself the character? Hypothesis: key hires (directors, lead animators) have authored mini-arcs. Rank-and-file have procedural traits. The studio's soul emerges from the aggregate.

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]
- The "run your own Pixar" hook is nuclear. When do we deploy it? Announcement trailer should lead with the storyboard room interface — corkboard, pinned drawings, the greenlight moment. That's the image. That's the GIF.
- Demo strategy: a single film production from greenlight to release. Let the player experience one full pipeline cycle. End with the box office weekend and the awards ceremony. That's the demo that converts.
- Do we lean into nostalgia? The 2000s animation era is hitting peak nostalgia for the 25-35 demographic right now. Shrek memes are eternal. The "2D animation died" narrative is well-known. This is a game about an era people already care about — the marketing should amplify that emotional connection.
- Festival strategy: This is a Day of the Devs game. It's a PAX game. The diegetic studio interface is inherently photogenic and streamable. Prioritize events where people can see the game running and feel the atmosphere.
- Steam tags hypothesis: Simulation, Management, Strategy, Singleplayer, Indie, Building, Economy, Choices Matter, 2D, Atmospheric. Cross-pollinate with the Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, and Software Inc. audiences.

### Next Steps

1. **Prototype the Greenlight Table and Film DNA System on paper.** This is the game's atomic unit — greenlight a film, make decisions, see the DNA scores emerge. If this doesn't feel meaningful on paper, nothing else matters. Two weeks.
2. **Build the Production Pipeline Board as a digital prototype.** The visual left-to-right pipeline with clickable phases. Placeholder art is fine — the interaction model needs to be proven. One month.
3. **Design and balance the Technology Tree.** Map every CG breakthrough from 1995-2010 to a tech tree node. Determine costs, research times, and production impact. This is the strategic skeleton. Two weeks.
4. **Write 30 procedural film concept templates.** These are the pitches that arrive at the Greenlight Table. Each needs a premise, a tone, a target audience, and enough variables to feel different on repeated plays. Test whether they feel authored or algorithmic. One month.
5. **Prototype the Box Office Gauntlet.** A standalone system: input Film DNA scores, output a four-week box office trajectory with critic reviews and audience word-of-mouth. This needs to feel dramatic and legible — the player must understand WHY a film succeeded or failed. Two weeks.
6. **Mood art and audio prototype.** The storyboard room. The render farm at night. The screening room. The corkboard with pinned drawings. The warmth. The hum. If the studio doesn't feel like a place you want to spend time, the game fails. One month.
7. **Steam page goes live the moment the storyboard room GIF exists.** That GIF is the entire marketing strategy in five seconds. Corkboard. Pinned drawings. A greenlight stamp coming down. The studio glowing at night. Wishlists start accumulating from day one.

*This pitch document was generated by REED (Game Designer), NOVA (Narrative Designer), and HYPE (Marketing). The game lives or dies on one question: can the Production Pipeline feel like genuine creative stewardship — the joy and agony of shepherding art through a machine — rather than a series of resource allocation puzzles? If the player feels like a studio head and not an optimizer, FRAMEWAR is a classic.*
